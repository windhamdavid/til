The secondary vanity in the master was a previous addition which will be removed. Ginny will be taking the upstairs office and I will be moving mine into the [den as a studio](/notes/house/studio)

## Log

- **24/11/01** - started an [idea book of photos](https://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/178757457/list/bathroom) for finishing and other details.
- **24/10/28** - timeline on this got bumped due to [helene repairs](/notes/house/helene). Contractor has given us an completion estimate of March 2025.

## Design

We want to stay 'true' to the original house. The style is a contemporary craftsman built in 1979. The current bathrooms use hexagonal tiles, bulb makeup style vanity lighting, and contemporary hardware. Both showers/tubs are fiberglass insets but we'd like to move to a lipless tiled glassed shower and a freestanding tub. A second vanity/sink addition was made sometime during the 80s which we'd like to remove. 

## Materials

- Tile - light colored
- Lighting - dimmable led ceiling and bulb vanity
- Cabinets - white/light/wood colored
- Shelves - towel/laundry
- Mirror - single mounted - no frame
- Shower - wand attachments
- Bath - freestanding round non-jetted
- Windows - matching wood shutters
