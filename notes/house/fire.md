# Fireplaces

25/08/26 - I stopped building fires in the fireplaces a couple of years ago. I think I got tired of wasting the energy... stacking wood, waiting up late to make sure the fire was out and so on. And that's not to mention that we just don't have that much cold weather to endure. I do remember so remarkably cold nights last year though so I'm thinking about switching them out to gas. 

We had a gas fireplace in our last house. It wasn't any more efficient or charming that the wood burning fireplaces. It was just gas logs and a blower. This time it's gonna be direct vent.. where the entire unit is sealed and pulls the oxygen down from the chimney. Now that the gas lines are in, I had to get some measurements to get the process started. I've started this note on the pricing and install options.  

estimate guess is at least **$8000** - even if it saves a couple hundred a month for the four cold months, it'd take ten years.
