# Issues

We've had some hiccups along the way, so I just wanted to start list of issues we've had with the general contractor and sub contractors so they're not forgotten when we need to reference them.

## Punch List

**Exterior**
- rear upper deck & railings
  - deck light
- chimney seal, cap, & wrap
- caps on doubled 2x12s
  - was told they would be caulked to look like 4x12s
- insulation and pipes in crawlspace
- gap sealant on gas exhaust
  - end screens on gas exhaust
- proper drainage valves on hot water heater
- gutters left metal intact from previous gutters
  - leaving visible gaps under the shingles that are large enough that small critters could enter the attic. 
  - missing downspouts on gutters
  - hole in gutter to right of entrance
  - water dripping along wood under upper gutter.
  - leaking downspout connector entrance
- painting in spots
- front doors - were measured but not follow up
- haul off
  - truss & doors
  - ladder from painters
- replace 3 gallons of exterior paint
  - or 2 since you're leaving two extra trim

**Interior**

  - missing closet lights
  - dimming led cans

- broken shower wand tube

- stairwell trim paint baseboards
- carpet to tile transition

**Minor**
- window treatments 
  - tub / vertical blinds
  - remove curtain rod
- tv mount


## Management

- Timeliness 
  - slow pace - some contractors will work for just a couple of hours a day for a week.
  - took **over a year** to complete the project or **9 months** if you account for the truss manufacturing delay
- very little inspection of work 
- General contractor has only been by the site once to check up on work
  - after the trusses were installed
- Assistant to GC not on site often
  - once was after a leak
- Not much supervision of subs
- Communication lackluster
  - Inconsistent notice of subcontractors arriving onsite
    - sometimes no notice and sometimes just 15 minute notice
- Broken Sewer Line
  - blowout line crushed by one of the haul off trucks or the lift equipment
- Subcontractors
  - contractor 💩 in our backyard - dog was eating something and noticed the roll of toilet paper
  - contractors peeing in our driveway
  - contractor puked in the yard because he came hungover
  - left food trash in buckets upstairs that caused am indoor bug infestation
  - dumped rotten food in bushes
  - paint in bushes and on house in cleaning
- had to drive over to GA to confirm quartz because couldn't get what was promised
- didn't fix cut drywall in downstairs bathroom for three months
  - left it open and we taped the piece back into it
- contractors on site past normal working hours
- contractor fishing in pond putting fish in bucket

## Craftsmanship

- studio left without hardware for three months
- leaking seal on pipe that ran into the wall and stained the ceiling on the floor below in both the den and downstairs bathroom
- hot water install mixed with cold water
  - we didn't have cold water for a couple days
- covered existing electrical outlets
- didn't seal off area of drywall sanding
  - no ventilation or air treatment
  - didn't replace hvac intakes
- installed tile inset the wrong direction
- left hvac ducts unpatched for months. I finally patched them.
- poured water under the house instead of piping it out
- left a pile of debris in the yard for three months
- left the old sliding door in the yard for a month
- we personally hauled off several loads of trash
- popcorn ceiling has visible seams
- drywall not consistent or square in spots
  - dropping drywall at hvac intake
  - not square where the corners meet
  - didn't use the waterproof type throughout the bathroom
  - made patches where it should have been an entire board replaced
- ripped out a closet that didn't need to be removed
- threw away good materials and unnecessary demo
  - duct vents, bi-fold doors
- broke glass into the yard by tossing shower doors over the ledge
- didn't plug the two HVAC vents that were ducted into the closed ceiling
- found a previously split truss just one truss back from what was installed
  - didn't mention it to us
- left the extra truss in our yard for nine months
- didn't patch the ceiling until months after the trusses installed
  - $600 heating cost to heat ceiling area
- didn't tile all the way to the ceiling in shower as requested
- don't clean up after work
  - trash/food in yard, nails/metal in bushes
- paint on window hardware
- paint on tile floor
- had to repaint and drywall because of poor work
- didn't install backing support for grab bar
- spilled a heavy amount of paint thinner into the subfloor which then permeated the house for a week causing headaches and eye irritation. So potent that any heating element like our oven on the first floor gave off a lighter fluid smell for a week.
- put the new carpet down before the contractors had finished the other work
  - carpet has visable seams
  - carpet doesn't extent far enough under baseboards

## Billing

- quotes and invoicing incomplete
  - requested payment before work was completed
  - no discussion of invoicing changes
