# Issues

We've had some hiccups along the way, so I just wanted to start list of issues we've had with the general contractor and sub contractors so they're not forgotten in case we need it.

**Management**
- General contractor has only been by the site once to check up on work - after the trusses were installed
- Assistant to GC has only been by four times 
  - got upset when we requested that a sub look at the broken sewer line
- Not much supervision of subs
- Communication lackluster
  - quotes and invoicing incomplete
  - requested payment before work was completed
- Timeliness 
  - slow pace - some contractors will work for just a couple of hours a day for a week.
- Broken Sewer Line
  - blowout line crushed by one of the haul off trucks or the lift equipment
- Subcontractors
  - contractor shit in our backyard - dog was eating something and noticed the roll of toilet paper
  - contractors peeing in our driveway
  - contractor puked in the yard because he came hungover
  - left food trash in buckets upstairs that caused a bug infestation
- had to drive over to GA to confirm quartz because couldn't get what was promised
- 

**Craftsmanship**

- left a pile of debris in the yard for three months
- left the old sliding door in the yard for two months
- we personally hauled off several loads of trash
- drywall not consistent or square in spots
  - dropping drywall at hvac intake
  - not square where the corners meet
  - didn't use the waterproof type throughout the bathroom
  - make patches where it should have been an entire board replaced
- ripped out a closet that didn't need to be removed
- threw away good materials and unnecessary demo
  - duct vents, bi-fold doors
- broke glass into the yard by tossing shower doors over the ledge
- didn't plug the two HVAC vents that were ducted into the closed ceiling
- didn't patch the ceiling until months after the trusses installed
  - $600 heating cost to heat ceiling area
- don't clean up after work
  - sawdust in the drive
  - trash in yard
- broken hardware on bifold doors
- paint on tile floor

**Costs**

- Requested payment before work was completed
  - saying that y'all 'had a lot of money' out there
- promissed to charge costs on materials
