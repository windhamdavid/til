## Property / Land

![adger_house](/img/adger_house.jpg)

Weather, Groceries, Healthcare, Taxes, Accessibility, Social, and Demographics are impotant factors. Some possible locations include Tryon, NC / Flat Rock, NC / Columbus, NC / Saluda, NC / Landrum, SC / Campobello, SC / Green Creek NC / Mill Spring, NC / Brevard, NC / Pisgah Forest, NC / Yamasee, SC / Sunset, SC / Walhalla, SC... or where we are now in Greenwood, SC.

### Considerations

- low grade
  - south facing
- small distance to
  - healthcare
  - grocery
  - social
- large lot
- neighborhood
  - HOA if small and well managed
  - walkable
  - building restrictions timeline
- taxes / appraisal
  - adjoining property values
