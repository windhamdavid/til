# Helene

![](/img/helene-1.jpg)

**24/10/05** - Hurricane Helene rolled through last week and did some damage mainly from the three and a half ton oak tree that fell on the house. I'm taking photos and making notes here to keep up with the details. I wrote up a post @ [/posts/hurricane-helene](/posts/hurricane-helene) and published additional damage photos @ [/wha/glenridge/#helene](https://davidawindham.com/wha/glenridge/#helene)
