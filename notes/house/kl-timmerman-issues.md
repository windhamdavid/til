These are our notes related to the hurrican helene [repairs](/notes/house/helene) and post helene renovations on the [studio](/notes/house/studio), master, and [bath](/notes/house/bath). I'm using this page to share some questions and comments with the contractor and the boss.

We've had some hiccups along the way, so I just wanted to start list of issues we've had with the general contractor and sub contractors so they're not forgotten if we need to reference them.

## Management

- Showed up on site unannounced requesting payment before work was completed or inspected
- Invoicing duplicate errors
  - No discussion of invoices
  - invoices not organized
- Timeliness 🐢
  - slow pace - some contractors will work for just a couple of hours a day for a week.
  - took almost a year - **10 months** if you account for the truss manufacturing delay to complete the project
- very little inspection of work - **NO** final inspection
- General contractor has only been by the site a couple times to check up on work
  - after the trusses were installed and after the interior paint
- Assistant to GC not on site often
  - once on an emergency call after a leak
- Not much supervision of subs
- Communication lackluster
  - Inconsistent notice of subcontractors arriving onsite
    - sometimes no notice and sometimes just short notice
- Broken Sewer Line
  - blowout line crushed by one of the haul off trucks or the lift equipment
- Subcontractors

## Craftsmanship

  - no ventilation or air treatment
  - didn't replace hvac intakes

- left a pile of debris in the yard for three months
- left the old sliding door in the yard for a month
- we personally hauled off several loads of trash
- popcorn ceiling has visible seams
- drywall not consistent or square in spots
  - dropping drywall at hvac intake
  - not square where the corners meet 👈🏻
  - didn't use the waterproof type throughout the bathroom
  - made patches where it should have been an entire board replaced
  - bubbles showing through the paint

- threw away good materials and unnecessary demo
  - duct vents & bi-fold doors

- broke glass into the yard by tossing shower doors over the ledge
- didn't plug the two HVAC vents that were ducted into the closed ceiling
- found a previously split truss just one truss back from what was installed
  - noticed but **didn't** mention it to us or offer to replace

- don't clean up after work
  - trash/food in yard, nails/metal in bushes
- paint on window hardware
- paint on tile floor
- paint spills on front porch
- had to repaint from bad work on drywall
  - still have bubbling in the paint in spots 👈🏻
- spilled a heavy amount of paint thinner into the subfloor which then permeated the house for a week causing headaches and eye irritation. So potent that any heating element like our oven on the first floor gave off a lighter fluid smell for a week.
- window treatments 
  - tub / vertical blinds
  - remove curtain rod
- put the new carpet down before the contractors had finished the other work
  - carpet has visible seams
  - carpet doesn't extend far enough under baseboards
