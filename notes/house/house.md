# House

I'm going to use this as place to make notes about our house, property, and future properties. We currently live in Greenwood SC and have been here for almost 14 years. I grew up in Columbia, Irmo, and Chapin SC. I spent 16 years in and around Charleston SC. I've lived in some other places short term such as: Bozeman MT, Stowe VT, Keene NH, and Maui HI, but I always seem to return to my roots. Perhaps it's the sound of cicadas, the weather, or the people, but the Carolinas always feel like home. It's fun to travel, but moving is tiring and disruptive so I'd like to only move on more time in my lifetime.

## Future

We'd like to build one more house that's single story, accessible, affordable, easy-to-maintain, and energy-efficient. Large lot, views, quiet, near quality grocery/healthcare/rec.  I've moved all of the docs on this over to [notes/house/build](/notes/house/build) and I've got my original notes on the build and architecture @ <https://davidawindham.com/architecture/>
