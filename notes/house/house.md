# House

( 23/08/19 ) I'm going to use this as place to make notes about our house, property, and future build. We currently live in Greenwood SC and have been here for almost 14 years. I grew up not too far from here in Columbia and Chapin. I spent 16 years in and around Charleston SC. I've lived in some other places relatively short term: Bozeman MT, Stowe VT, Keene NH, and Maui HI. I always seem to return to my roots and would't live any other place. Perhaps it's the sound of cicadas, the weather, or the people, but the Carolinas always feel like home. It's fun to travel, but moving is tiring and disruptive so I'm hoping to move only **one** more time in my lifetime.

<div style={{display: 'flex',  justifyContent:'center', alignItems:'center', marginBottom:'20px'}}>‚òùüèº full size rendering is @ [/wha/glenridge](https://davidawindham.com/wha/glenridge/#render)</div>

We asked the neighborhood developer who sold the house for the architectural renderings but he didn't have them. We spoken to the original owners ( Lee & Sandra Foltz ) who had the house built in 1979 who said the house was built by Henry Reynolds. The neighborhood ( [Gatewood](https://gatewoodclub.com) ) was established on 450 acres in 1973 and is just outside the Greenwood city limits.
