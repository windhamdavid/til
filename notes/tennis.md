## Policy

### Player Expectations
I will not tolerate bad behavior from my players. Throwing a racquet, cursing, having bad attitudes, or otherwise disrespectful behavior toward others during practice or matches will result in suspended participation. The SCHSL ( South Carolina High School League ) requires that I enforce game suspension rules for matches but I will also be enforcing them for practice as well because I believe it’s an opportunity for our student-athletes to learn to control their emotions and the importance of good sportsmanship. I want our team to be respectful of our home and guest facilities. The Greenwood Country Club will ask our players to sign an agreement to follow their rules and I will enforce them using play suspensions.

### Communications
I will be using Remind ( remind.com ) to communicate with all of the parents and athletes. I will send reminders, schedule changes, weather delays, and arrival/pick-up times for away matches. I will respond to any messages sent to me during the season in a timely manner. If there is ever an emergency for which I do not respond to the app notification, parents and guardians are welcome to contact me using one of the numbers listed above.

### Student Participation
Our Athletic Department at Emerald High School is placing a great emphasis on student- athlete academic performance. Students must maintain good grades and report them as requested. Emerald has assigned a student-athlete coach that will be able to provide additional resources as needed. I would like our team to be professional in both their gameplay and appearance. The district will provide uniform tops and I would like our players to order matching appropriate footwear and shorts. These are to be worn at all matches and scrimmages. Group discounts are available and I will provide financial support if needed. I will also require that all players have a one-gallon water container for all practices and matches. All players should also have a tennis bag for their racquets, a towel, extra apparel, and any other equipment.

### Parent Participation
Our away matches are generally within an hour's drive, so I prefer that all of the players ride together. The district will provide a vehicle for transportation that I drive. We will always depart and arrive from in front of the EHS gym. I do not like stopping for food on the way home, but I would like to reward the team with a dinner every so often when we get back into town which you will be notified of in advance. I will bring snacks and drinks to our home matches, but you are welcome to contribute. I encourage you to come to support our team whenever possible.

### Practice Schedule
Monday - Fridays 4:00 to 5:30 pm
Greenwood Country Club - 607 W Cambridge Ave, Greenwood, SC 29649 First Practice - Monday, January 30th
I generally try to match the school schedule with holidays, but I will sometimes hold non- required practices on non-school days. Practice will depend on the weather so I will send notices of canceled/rescheduled practice. I will also occasionally cancel Friday practices depending on my own schedule. I expect our players to be on the court and ready to play at 4:00 pm for practice.

### Match Schedule
Matches begin at 5 and can last up to four hours. I try to get them started early. Our match schedule is sometimes determined by the weather so it may change from week to week. I will schedule a couple of non-division scrimmages matches with other regional teams so that our players can get more practice. Here is the preliminary schedule for this season.

## Coach Bio 


1. Did you play Tennis when you were younger? 

I started playing tennis in third or fourth grade and was introduced to junior league tennis by my friend's parents. I began taking it more seriously after I started winning tournaments and made the high school team while still in middle school. One of the best things about tennis is that it can be played at any age. 

2. Why did you decide to teach girls tennis? 

I wanted to give back to my community and I have a deep respect for the game of tennis. I value watching new players learn the challenges and rewards of playing.  I enjoyed being the assistant coach before I was asked to be the head coach.  

3. What is your favorite thing about coming to Emerald? 

It reminds me of being in school and the many years bringing my wife lunch, who had an office at Emerald High school while serving as the school psychologist. I hope one day that we will have our own tennis courts at Emerald so that we might introduce the game to other students in physical education classes. 

4. What is your favorite quote? 

"A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.” ~ Lawrence Pearsall Jacks ( Education through Recreation, 1932 )


And if you are able could you send me a picture of you from your shoulders and up? 

I do not have a headshot, but here’s a photo of me playing tennis. - https://davidawindham.com/collaboration-vs-competition/


I’m happy to be coaching the Emerald High School Tennis teams. Even though I have a lot of tennis experience, I am relatively new to coaching. In 2022, I was asked to be assistant coach by the previous coach and the athletic director at Emerald asked me if I’d be interested in becoming head coach in 2022. I work as an independent software and web developer so my schedule is gracious enough to allow me to coach and play tennis. I’ve found great rewards from watching the kids learn and grow. I grew up in Columbia and played a lot of tennis as a junior becoming all-region in high school and state-ranked. I had some really good coaches as a junior and a scholarship to play tennis at Lander. At the time, I told my parents that ‘I didn’t want to live in Greenwood’, so it’s funny how things work out. I started back playing tennis about six years ago for the health benefits. Tennis is a very rewarding and demanding sport both physically and mentally. My approach is that I want them to grow as players who are able to have fun in the process. Ginny, my wife, also plays tennis and will be my assistant coach. She is the director of Special Education for Greenwood District 50. Ginny previously worked as the lead psychologist for the district and had an office at Emerald for many years.
