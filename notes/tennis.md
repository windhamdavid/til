## Policy

### Player Expectations
I will not tolerate bad behavior from my players. Throwing a racquet, cursing, having bad attitudes, or otherwise disrespectful behavior toward others during practice or matches will result in suspended participation. The SCHSL ( South Carolina High School League ) requires that I enforce game suspension rules for matches but I will also be enforcing them for practice as well because I believe it’s an opportunity for our student-athletes to learn to control their emotions and the importance of good sportsmanship. I want our team to be respectful of our home and guest facilities. The Greenwood Country Club will ask our players to sign an agreement to follow their rules and I will enforce them using play suspensions.

### Communications
I will be using Remind ( remind.com ) to communicate with all of the parents and athletes. I will send reminders, schedule changes, weather delays, and arrival/pick-up times for away matches. I will respond to any messages sent to me during the season in a timely manner. If there is ever an emergency for which I do not respond to the app notification, parents and guardians are welcome to contact me using one of the numbers listed above.

### Student Participation
Our Athletic Department at Emerald High School is placing a great emphasis on student- athlete academic performance. Students must maintain good grades and report them as requested. Emerald has assigned a student-athlete coach that will be able to provide additional resources as needed. I would like our team to be professional in both their gameplay and appearance. The district will provide uniform tops and I would like our players to order matching appropriate footwear and shorts. These are to be worn at all matches and scrimmages. Group discounts are available and I will provide financial support if needed. I will also require that all players have a one-gallon water container for all practices and matches. All players should also have a tennis bag for their racquets, a towel, extra apparel, and any other equipment.

### Parent Participation
Our away matches are generally within an hour's drive, so I prefer that all of the players ride together. The district will provide a vehicle for transportation that I drive. We will always depart and arrive from in front of the EHS gym. I do not like stopping for food on the way home, but I would like to reward the team with a dinner every so often when we get back into town which you will be notified of in advance. I will bring snacks and drinks to our home matches, but you are welcome to contribute. I encourage you to come to support our team whenever possible.

### Practice Schedule
Monday - Fridays 4:00 to 5:30 pm
Greenwood Country Club - 607 W Cambridge Ave, Greenwood, SC 29649 First Practice - Monday, January 30th
I generally try to match the school schedule with holidays, but I will sometimes hold non- required practices on non-school days. Practice will depend on the weather so I will send notices of canceled/rescheduled practice. I will also occasionally cancel Friday practices depending on my own schedule. I expect our players to be on the court and ready to play at 4:00 pm for practice.

### Match Schedule
Matches begin at 5 and can last up to four hours. I try to get them started early. Our match schedule is sometimes determined by the weather so it may change from week to week. I will schedule a couple of non-division scrimmages matches with other regional teams so that our players can get more practice. Here is the preliminary schedule for this season.
