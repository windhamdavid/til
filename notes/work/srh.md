# SRH

( **25/10/23** ) I first started working for SRH in early 2015 making edits and code changes at the request of another web developer. In early 2016 I was asked to build a physicians directory to replace the existing system. It was published in May of that year, but the first invoice directly to SRH was in 2017.
