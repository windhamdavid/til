## About

**23/12/18** - Started this page because I was thinking about my January taxes. I have a love-hate relationship with money. I grew up mostly middle-class but with a fair amount of privilege mainly due to my dad's relative social standing. I live in a community with a high poverty rate which helps keep my feet on the ground[^1]. I went to college without any concerns of money and studied art. I shifted my views when I began paying for it and switched to studying to become an actuary because of the starting salary. I worked in some fairly high-end trades associated with money and what I've noticed is that being happy has nothing to do with it, unless, of course, you don't have any. I've had a couple of businesses now and have always bemoaned the accounting parts.

[^1]: note: there are now 700,000 homeless people in the US.

I really don't like talking money to folks. I always try to be straightforward and fair. I'm mostly conservative in my approach and I don't mean that in the obvious way. I mostly try to consume very little. I've noticed that being 'rich' is mostly a state of mind which means just not having to worry about it which is what I try to do most often. I certainly don't want to actively monitor money for a living and I'm at the stage in life now, where I just don't want to take on any debt, and investing in my health seems like the most advantageous thing to focus on.

## Business

I remember heading into my first corporate job and all of the fellas on my team were spending half of their days trading currencies and whatnot. Since then, I've always had the attitude that my biggest investment will always be myself. I like to reinvest in my own knowledge. I told my broker that I wanted to be hands-on and since then, I've just been learning whatever I'm able. It's an amazing amount of knowledge needed to actually know what you're doing, so I'm diving in here.

## Accounts

I've got kinda a duality in that I'm all in on the digital future while simultaneously prioritizing the basic necessities of life around the world. I try my best to be somewhat ethical in my investments. I try to remind myself that 'not thinking about it' is the epitome of wealth. And for that reason, I'm just try to bet on the long term cultural changes and the fact that we're continuing to evolve.
