## About

23/12/18 - Started this page because I was thinking about my January taxes. I have a love-hate relationship with money. I grew up mostly middle-class but with a fair amount of privilege mainly due to my dad's relative social standing. I live in a community with a high poverty rate which helps keep me on the ground. I went to college without the faintest concerns about money studying art but shifted my views when I began paying for it and switched to studying to become an actuary because of the starting salary. I also think I was dating a surgeon at that point. I worked in some fairly high-end trades dealing with wine and real estate which was associated with some serious money. What I've noticed is that being happy and having fun has nothing to do with it, unless, of course, you don't have any. I've had a couple of businesses and always bemoaned the accounting parts. I don't like talking money to folks and I always try to be straightforward and fair. I'm mostly conservative in my approach and I don't mean that in the obvious way... I mostly try to consume very little. I've noticed that being 'rich' is mostly a state of mind which means just not having to worry about it which is what I try to do most often. I certainly don't want to actively monitor money for a living and I'm at the stage in life now, where I just don't want to take on any debt, and investing in my health seems like the most advantageous thing to focus on.
