# Tennis

I played a lot of tennis as junior and started back after a twenty-five year break at age 46 because I needed the exercise. I love the game for a bunch of reasons. I started coaching the high school tennis teams a couple years ago and enjoy it as well. My favorite tennis quotes:

- your biggest opponent on the court is yourself
- don't let someone else dictate your style of play
- control the points, the pace, the court
- you're only as good as your weakest shots
- equal amounts of defense and offense at the right times
- find your opponent's biggest strength and take that away first
- don't motivate your oppponent unless you just want a challenge
- figure out what works and do that over and over
- in life, there are things to worry about and tennis just isn't one of them

24/12/10 - Due to a recenty injury, I decided I’d whip up a decision tree on wether of not I should resign from my tennis coaching gig before the next season. The timing is more appropriate right now with the injury and upcoming projects. Asked my friends and parents to vote on it as well. I've decided **that I'm staying on as head coach**, but I figured I'd put it here for posterity.


| YEA | NAY |
|---|---|
|Rewarding|Taxing|
| - Contribute back to the community - learn a lot more about the community.| - lose money - cost more than it pays because I spend it on snacks, travel, gifts, and equipment|
| - Good reference of character - for folks that don’t know me and helps a little bit with Ginny’s involvement with the district | - too much work. have other important work priorities coming up - the SRH rebuild project and the AI project.|
| - good way to meet new community members. Meet a lot of new people and learn more about them| - too much responsibility - AD secretary out, driving, organizing, recruiting, dealing with parents and communication.|
| - good way to be a positive influence on kids and adults.| - takes too much time - other priorities like Iris, Ginny’s dissertation, and the house - got contractor’s here first four months of next year, taking a more active role in managing retirement accounts                             |
| good for health | bad for health - recent injury|
| - good for mental health, being social and interacting with a lot of others who have more serious issues.| - too much sun, stress on joints, recent muscle injury, ankle issues, wrist issue|
| it’s fun - I have fun most of the time| - liability - good chance I’ll curse or say something inappropriate to one of the kids and end up having a lot senseless meetings so others can feel important.|
|| - want to start a more wholistic exercise routine that sustainable - walking, swimming, pilates, yoga - emphasize stretching and low impact|
| good at it| Got bumped to a 4.5 rating which means no personal opportunity for league play without traveling out of town.|
| like ‘some’ of the kids on the team - good to see them grow | Not a lot of kids I like that much on the team in the coming years - lost two, more recruiting and beginners - not real thrilled about having a distant relative pulling me into other family dynamics|
|| Not a lot of support from the local pros - taking up court space and time at the club where club pro is nearing retirement and other one is protective of his afterschool program - courts in bad condition - losing kids to GHS. |
| keeps me on a regular schedule having practices every afternoon.| league changes - moved to AAAA and have a new division chair - not much opportunity for success|
|| not a big fan of a lot of tennis players - too much competitiveness and I don’t think that’s really more of what we need.|
| I like the AD - nice guy trying to do good work| young AD trying to prove himself w/ district that has some challenges means more responsibility - only fun when I don’t have to work that much.|
|| not entirely committed to community - may build future home elsewhere|
| I might find out that I  miss it later on and want to come back to it.| Timing is good with injury and other work going on - can always voluntarily come back and assist the team.|
| helps grow the sport and community of tennis - good role model||

RE: 2023 Girls Varsity Tennis

Dear EHS Parents and Players, 

I’m happy to be back as head coach of the Emerald High School Varsity Girls Tennis Team. For those of you who may not know me, here’s a brief bio: This will be my second year as head coach of the girl's and boys’ tennis teams. I’ve lived in Greenwood for 15 years. I work as a software developer which allows me a flexible schedule to be able to coach. I grew up in Columbia, SC playing competitive tennis and I love the game. My wife, Ginny Gast who is the director of Special Services for the district will also be assisting as her schedule permits.

Practice Schedule:
First Practice - Wednesday, Aug 2nd, 4:00 pm
Mon - Thu 4:00 - 5:30 - Greenwood Country Club
607 W Cambridge Ave, Greenwood, SC 29649
*Sometimes Fridays depending on our schedule 


Match Schedule:
09/07 - Open
09/12 - vs Woodruff
09/14 - @ Chester
09/19 - @ Union
09/21 - vs Clinton
09/26 - Scrimmage ( TBD )
09/28 - @ Woodruff
10/03 - vs Chester
10/05 - vs Union
10/10 - @ Clinton


Communications:
I use Remind for all team communications and I encourage parents to also sign up. You may do so by visiting https://############### or texting the message “@##########” to either ######### or ^^&&&&&&&&. I will send reminders, schedule changes, weather delays, and arrival/pick-up times for away matches. I will always check my phone during scheduled practices and matches, but on off hours, you are welcome to contact me via phone. 



Student Participation
Our Athletic Department at Emerald High School places a great emphasis on student-athlete academic performance. Students must maintain good grades and report them as requested. Emerald has assigned a student-athlete coach that will be able to provide additional resources as needed. All students must to have thier physicals and information entered into PlanetHS. Please contact Tonya Branyon, our athletic department secretary for assistance. 

Player Expectations:
I would like our team to be professional in both their gameplay and appearance. The district will provide uniform tops and I would like our players to order matching appropriate footwear and shorts. These are to be worn at all matches and scrimmages. I will also require that all players have a one-gallon water container for all practices and matches. All players should also have a tennis bag for their racquets, a towel, extra apparel, and any other equipment needed.

I will not tolerate bad behavior from my players. Throwing a racquet, cursing, or disrespectful behavior towards others during practice or matches will result in suspended participation. I believe it’s an opportunity for our student-athletes to learn to control their emotions and the importance of good sportsmanship. I want our team to be respectful of our home and guest facilities. The Greenwood Country Club will ask our players to sign an agreement to follow their rules and I will enforce them with play suspensions. 

Parent Participation
Our away matches are generally within an hour's drive, so I prefer that all of the players ride together. The district will provide a vehicle for transportation that I drive. We will always depart and arrive from in front of the EHS gym.  I will send a reminder of our estimated time of arrival so that you can meet us. I do not like stopping for food on the way home, but I would like to reward the team with a dinner every so often when we get back into town which you will be notified of in advance. I will bring snacks and drinks to our home matches, but you are welcome to contribute. I encourage you to come to support our team whenever possible.

For me, as a coach, the most important aspect of the game is that our players learn to give it their best effort, treat their opponents, teammates, and coaches with respect, try to improve, gain confidence, and have fun while doing it.  I appreciate your support and please let me know if you have any questions.  Let’s have a great season. 

Thank you, 
Coach ( David ) Windham 


## Policy 2022

Player Expectations
I will not tolerate bad behavior from my players. Throwing a racquet, cursing, having bad attitudes, or otherwise disrespectful behavior toward others during practice or matches will result in suspended participation. The SCHSL ( South Carolina High School League ) requires that I enforce game suspension rules for matches but I will also be enforcing them for practice as well because I believe it’s an opportunity for our student-athletes to learn to control their emotions and the importance of good sportsmanship. I want our team to be respectful of our home and guest facilities. The Greenwood Country Club will ask our players to sign an agreement to follow their rules and I will enforce them using play suspensions.

Communications
I will be using Remind ( remind.com ) to communicate with all of the parents and athletes. I will send reminders, schedule changes, weather delays, and arrival/pick-up times for away matches. I will respond to any messages sent to me during the season in a timely manner. If there is ever an emergency for which I do not respond to the app notification, parents and guardians are welcome to contact me using one of the numbers listed above.

Practice Schedule
Monday - Fridays 4:00 to 5:30 pm
Greenwood Country Club - 607 W Cambridge Ave, Greenwood, SC 29649 First Practice - Monday, January 30th
I generally try to match the school schedule with holidays, but I will sometimes hold non- required practices on non-school days. Practice will depend on the weather so I will send notices of canceled/rescheduled practice. I will also occasionally cancel Friday practices depending on my own schedule. I expect our players to be on the court and ready to play at 4:00 pm for practice.

Match Schedule
Matches begin at 5 and can last up to four hours. I try to get them started early. Our match schedule is sometimes determined by the weather so it may change from week to week. I will schedule a couple of non-division scrimmages matches with other regional teams so that our players can get more practice. Here is the preliminary schedule for this season.

## Coach Bio 


1. Did you play Tennis when you were younger? 

I started playing tennis in third or fourth grade and was introduced to junior league tennis by my friend's parents. I began taking it more seriously after I started winning tournaments and made the high school team while still in middle school. One of the best things about tennis is that it can be played at any age. 

2. Why did you decide to teach girls tennis? 

I wanted to give back to my community and I have a deep respect for the game of tennis. I value watching new players learn the challenges and rewards of playing.  I enjoyed being the assistant coach before I was asked to be the head coach.  

3. What is your favorite thing about coming to Emerald? 

It reminds me of being in school and the many years bringing my wife lunch, who had an office at Emerald High school while serving as the school psychologist. I hope one day that we will have our own tennis courts at Emerald so that we might introduce the game to other students in physical education classes. 

4. What is your favorite quote? 

"A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.” ~ Lawrence Pearsall Jacks ( Education through Recreation, 1932 )


And if you are able could you send me a picture of you from your shoulders and up? 

I do not have a headshot, but here’s a photo of me playing tennis. - https://davidawindham.com/collaboration-vs-competition/


I’m happy to be coaching the Emerald High School Tennis teams. Even though I have a lot of tennis experience, I am relatively new to coaching. In 2022, I was asked to be assistant coach by the previous coach and the athletic director at Emerald asked me if I’d be interested in becoming head coach in 2022. I work as an independent software and web developer so my schedule is gracious enough to allow me to coach and play tennis. I’ve found great rewards from watching the kids learn and grow. I grew up in Columbia and played a lot of tennis as a junior becoming all-region in high school and state-ranked. I had some really good coaches as a junior and a scholarship to play tennis at Lander. At the time, I told my parents that ‘I didn’t want to live in Greenwood’, so it’s funny how things work out. I started back playing tennis about six years ago for the health benefits. Tennis is a very rewarding and demanding sport both physically and mentally. My approach is that I want them to grow as players who are able to have fun in the process. Ginny, my wife, also plays tennis and will be my assistant coach. She is the director of Special Education for Greenwood District 50. Ginny previously worked as the lead psychologist for the district and had an office at Emerald for many years.
