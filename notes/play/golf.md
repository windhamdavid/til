# Golf

Although I'm not currently playing much, I'm putting this page here because I know I will eventually. I play golf once a year around father's day with my dad. My father has played golf almost everyday for the last fifty years. My grandfather taught me to play golf when I was very young. He played golf every day with his dog walking along. I've been telling my tennis cohorts that after my first tennis injury, I'm switching to golf. And I've asked the high school coach if I could take over for him when he finally retires from it.

I have a note in my desktop files entitled "dog friendly golf" mainly as a reminder to write up an essay on how I think playing golf while walking my dog is the perfect activity. More courses should be dog friendly. I'll make it happen before I get old because that's exactly what my grandfather did every morning. He'd load up his dog and go walk nine holes. It's how I got introduced to golf when I was just a wee lad.
