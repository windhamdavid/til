## About

I wrote an essay about this page @ [**davidawindham.com/a-second-brain/**](https://davidawindham.com/a-second-brain/)

**22/05/07** - I've separated the **technical** to [Docs](/docs/) and the **non-technical** to [Notes](index.md). As always, this Notes page started with me trying to solve something. It really bothers me for anything to take away my attention. In this case, I was trying to keep my Apple TV home screen clean so I don't have to see or surf through offers of other stuff to watch.  I curate an 'up next' list and I usually make notes that sync between my devices when someone mentions a movie or show. I usually handle this with 'quick Notes' that sync between devices. That mostly works, but the problem I'd like to have them all in one place so that I can archive and search what I've already watched much the same way I database my music listening habits. This will give me a simple searchable place to store it all without any complex APIs, databases, or whatnot. It's a work in progress :sweat_smile:.

What is a personal knowledge manager? And How could I possibly organize these notes? Some folks refer to it as a Second Brain - https://maggieappleton.com/basb & https://aliabdaal.com/how-to-build-a-second-brain-271393/

I like to use Apple Notes and quick mental notes and I started using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) markdown editor for looking at a pile of them on my computer. I noticed is that it's an easy way to map out some sense of order from a set of notes and documents.  The more I looked into it, I noticed that there is a whole subset of folks who are into **PKMs** ( **Personal Knowledge Management** ).  Evidently, I've been doing it for a while now since I'm accustomed to making my own documentation as I build software and websites.  As I was setting up my folder directories on a new computer ( [Ovid](/docs/computers/ovid) ), I noticed that it might be helpful to use the same approach to other aspects of my life so I created another set of documents here for the **non-technical** stuff.

I generally use four lists of reminders to keep up with everything. Groceries, Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long Term. I put everything on there and I can conveniently access and edit them from any device. For every project I build I keep a _notes.txt file containing all of the pertinent info.  I'm going to merge my old note into this site, so I have them all in one place. **Reminder**: try to match up my existing docs, notes, reminders, and start pages workflow. ... It's pretty hard wrapping your head around creating a Table of Contents for a knowledge base incorporating everything except technology. I'm just going to start adding an outline of potential topics and link to the pages as they are created.
