- 23/12/17 - bout that time of year to start thinking about losing weight so I spent some time this morning converting my health status downloads to a decent format and I figured I'd update this page and figure out a way to keep them in sync. 

> ^ keeping some items private via `draft` status and `.gitignore` ( No worries, I'm pretty sure my health insurer is getting a pretty good deal anyway )

## About

23/12/17 - I'd just like to keep some notes along the way so I have a reference. I'm just like everyone else about this time of year. I have a pretty holistic sorta mindset on health even though I've found myself with some weaknesses over the years. I smoked cigarettes in college and for a few years following. I'm in pretty good shape right now, but I come from a long line of plump little Welshmen so I'm privy to indulge. My eyes have suffered in recent years from screen time and the only DNA marker risk I have is macular degeneration. My dad and a couple of his brothers have onset diabetes so I'm going to try and avoid it altogether with exercise and diet. In regards to wholistic, I find it odd that folks will wear a device to track the thirty minutes of steps they do a day and ignore the other 1410 minutes. Aside from genetics, I think the most important impact on health is your routine, especially lifestyle, diet, sleep, and exercise so I'll start by logging some of those.

### Sync

I noticed a project not too long ago on Github that allows for an open-source export of your medical data from MyChart and others. Would like to explore that at some point so I could just sync the blood, lipid panel, and other tests... so I can move that data around at will mainly because I like the control and I think there will end up being decent AI diagnostic tools available in the future.
