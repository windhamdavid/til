## About

**23/12/17** - I've got what I would consider a pretty healthy diet. I eat a decent amount of vegetables, try to avoid processed foods, and don't eat much meat. I mostly buy organic and we cook the vast majority of our meals at home, only dining out on occasion or when traveling. I eat fish and chicken once a week and usually have one pasta dish on the weekend. I have an apple a day as my afternoon snack with peanut butter. My biggest weaknesses are cheese, carbs, and sliced ham because I like sandwiches for lunch on fresh bread.
