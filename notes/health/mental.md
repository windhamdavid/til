> Best wishes won't help.   He has a mass that was biopsied and still awaiting results.

Hey. Good morning. Well then... "best wishes" is just an expression of hope for someone's future welfare. While technically it won't help, it's just symbolic optimism. And if you don't have that, what do you have? It's your choice. I'm not naive enough to think I've got it figured out, but I can tell you what hasn't worked for me... nihilism, pessimism, cynicism, or apathy. There is ample scientific evidence that having a philosophy of hope has a definite influence on the outcome of those with medical conditions. So... let's try that again. I hope your friend is ok and I'm sending him my best wishes through you.

I'm going to tell you something personal to me that you probably don't want to hear given your recent medical struggles and the context. The way I see it is that I'm not preaching, I'm just sharing my own experience. I tried to subtly explain it to you recently with a dream I had, but I'll say it more clearly because what I'm going to say has also given me the confidence to say and do what I think is right.

As soon as I learned to embrace the art of forgiveness and hope, things just started going well in my life. Simple as that. Didn't find it in a book on philosophy or a religious text. Didn't coincide with trauma, mood, or event. Didn't depend on another person or relationship. Didn't happen with some sort of epiphany. I just woke up one morning and decided to change my attitude about a challenging project I was working on and started to notice the changes. Smile and the world smiles with you. There's nothing I take too seriously and I just try to be helpful to others. Everyone is dying, everyone is struggling, and everyone has their challenges. Time, health, money, relationships, medicine, psychology, religion, art, humor, or anything, in particular, won't necessarily fix it. They'll just treat the symptoms, so the only thing you can do is work hard every day to try and find a decent perspective of the world and your life just like everyone else.

I love you ❤️ I'll always try to lift you up. Just let me know if I can do anything to help.
