# Logic

I'm gonna use Logic Pro to record. I've dabbled with ProTools and Ableton. I use Adobe Audition somewhat regularly to cut audio, but I haven't spend much time with Logic Pro, much less with the MIDI features of a digital audio workstation. Thousand of buttons and lots to learn. I'll document it here.

I'd like to learn how to have a composition workflow where I can play a work out and play a piece and have it transcribed.  

As of now, my favorite thing to do is just noodle along to other tracks with the Fender Rhodes emulator.
