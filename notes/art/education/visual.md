#### South Carolina College- and Career-Ready Standards for Visual Arts Proficiency

## Introduction

Students who participate in the South Carolina standards-based education in the visual and performing arts are heirs to excellent arts opportunities and programs because of the vision and tenacity of generations of devoted arts educators in our state and throughout the nation.
It is important that all communities have visual art specialists with the knowledge and skills they need to teach art in a manner that will best enable students to learn. Organized lists of standards, benchmarks, s, and student learning targets help teachers to reach a high level of quality art instruction in a comprehensive arts education program for improved student growth. The South Carolina Department of Education recognizes the visual art standards as an essential resource for assisting and supporting excellent art teachers in schools. This visual-art teacher document presents the expectations for student growth and learning for Pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade.

This South Carolina Visual Arts document is designed to meet local and state and national visual arts standards and create individualized instruction for students. In addition, to align with the South Carolina Read to Succeed Act(Section 59-155-120 “Discipline-specific literacy”), we recognize that literacy is taught through the arts and have developed a statement explaining how administrators may support their teachers in all content areas in order to reinforce strong literacy-based classrooms. The purpose of this Visual Arts Literacy Policy Statement is to help administrators, principals, and teachers integrate literacy through the arts as effectively as possible. Referring to a wealth of information and research from leaders in the fields of arts disciplines, we will summarize our literacy statement position clearly and concisely. As arts educators, we believe in a broad definition of literacy by encouraging a multi literacy perspective for our students to make meaning. Expanding the clarity of literacy promotes broader understanding for our students, communication, individualized instruction, and inclusive learning environments. An extended curriculum includes visual literacy, musical literacy, the language of dance, literacy development through theatre, traditional print concepts to digital ones, and aligning reading comprehension strategies through the arts (Riddle, 2016).

Students are immersed cognitively when involved in the artistic process. The use of skills such as communication, creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving are truly embodied in their work. The visual and performing arts fall into all three 21St century thinking skills categories: learning and innovation skills, life and career skills, and technology skills. (21st Century Skills, 2009) These 21st century skills will contribute to student success in a global economy and culturally diverse environments.

New visual arts standards are written to be applicable across all content areas. Effective practices will be employed in all student work as a result of studying the South Carolina Academic Standards for the Visual and Performing Arts. The standards have been developed to support the key artistic processes of Creating, Responding, Performing, and Connecting taken from the National Core Arts Standards developed by the National Coalition for Core Arts Standards in 2014.The new 2016 South Carolina Academic Standards for the Visual and Performing Arts align with the National Standards and maintain the essential content of the 2010 South Carolina Academic Standards for the Visual and Performing Arts. However, there are changes to the layout and language in an effort to create standards that are centered around the student. The new standards provide proficiency levels for student expectations. The continuum permits flexibility in acknowledging that students will demonstrate growth through the artistic processes at varying degrees over time.

South Carolina Department of Education professional staff, in collaboration with members of the South Carolina Academic Standards Visual and Performing Arts Development Team, created this series of arts-standards documents. The 2017 South Carolina Academic Standards for the Visual and Performing Arts draws on the expertise of K–12 arts teachers and administrators who were nominated by district superintendents and the professional arts education organizations for dance, music, theatre, and visual arts. We are grateful to all who those contributed to this effort.

The 2017 South Carolina Academic Standards for the Visual and Performing Arts will serve as the basis for the continuation of the comprehensive sequential arts education system offered in our state. In addition, these standards provide guaranteed experiences for our students to grow, perform, and produce in the arts.

## Visual Arts Glossary

**Aesthetics** The branch of philosophy that deals with the nature and value of art objects and experiences. It is concerned with identifying the clues within works that can be used to understand, judge, and defend judgments about those works.  

**Artistic Literacy** Knowledge and understanding required to participate authentically in the arts. It is embodied in specific philosophical foundations and lifelong goals that enable an artistically literate person to transfer arts knowledge, skills, and capacities to other subjects, settings, and contexts. (National Core Arts Standards: A Conceptual Framework for Arts Learning, 2016.)  

**Artistic Problem** The question or problem presented to an artist that is meaningful and challenging for his or her level, to be solved through the artistic process. High quality artistic problems are developmentally appropriate and open-ended, supported by skill-building instruction, and designed to offer both challenge and opportunity for success.  

**Assess** Analyzing and determining the nature and quality of students' growth through means appropriate to the subject.In art education there are many instruments used in assessment: rubrics, checklists, and reflection are among them.  

**Brainstorm** Technique for the initial production of ideas or ways of solving a problem by an individual or group in which ideas are spontaneously contributed without critical comment or judgment. https://gallery.mailchimp.com/048ec2c9ab2aa5a1fedc0ea91/files/Standards_8x11_Visual_Arts_1.pdf  

**Composition/Organizational Strategies** An artist’s arrangement or organization of the objects within a work of visual art. Adjective form: compositional.  

**Craftsmanship** Evidence of performance with skill or dexterity, especially in the manual arts.  

**Creativity** The process by which something new and somehow valuable is conceived and/or made, as in art and design problem-solving.  

**Creative Practices** A student engaged in creative practices creates a mental image or concept, investigates and studies through exploration or examination, constructs a product by combining or arranging a series of elements, and reflects and thinks deeply about his/her work. http://www.nationalartsstandards.org/sites/default/files/Conceptual%20Framework%2007-21-16_0.pdf  

**Critique** A critique is an oral or written discussion strategy used to analyze, describe, and interpret works of art.  

**Dance Elements** The foundational concepts of movement that are body, action, space, time, energy.  

**Deconstructing** The process of separating and examining the parts in a work of visual art in order to better understand that work as a whole.  

**Elements and Principles of Art/Design** The basic design structural components of art and design including line, color, texture, shape, form, space, and value. Art principles include variety, unity, contrast, emphasis, movement, rhythm, pattern, and balance.  

**Intent** Purpose behind making a visual artwork whether personal or analyzed through the work made by others. Purposes include storytelling, advocacy or activism (propaganda), expression through symbol, decoration, beauty, investigation of a theme, and function (such as in design fields).  

**Learner Outcomes in the Arts** selected from the 21st Century Skills Map: The Arts. http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/P21_arts_map_final.pdf

**Communication Outcome**: Students will communicate in a variety of contexts through a variety of artistic media, including technologies, to convey their own ideas and to interpret the ideas of others.  

**Creativity Outcome**: Students will draw on a variety of sources to generate, evaluate, and select creative ideas to turn into personally meaningful products  

**Innovation Outcome**: Students will investigate new processes, implement creative ideas, and revisit traditional ideas to create new and reinterpret existing works of visual and performing arts.  

**Medium (Materials)** The material or technique used by an artist to produce a work of art. Medium can also refer to what carries a paint's pigments, and is also called a vehicle or a base. The medium is what determines what kind of paint is produced.  

**Portfolio** A portable case for holding material, such as loose drawings, photographs, or other images. It may also be the materials collected in such a case, especially when they are representative of an artist's work. By extension, a portfolio might be a portable collection of originals or reproductions of an artist's work in a format other than the traditional case — as a set of digital images online or on a disc for example.  

**Process (Artistic)** A complex operation involving a number of steps to complete any method or technique of art-making, such as the addition and subtraction processes in sculpture, the etching and intaglio processes in printmaking, constructing processes, or **drawing and painting processes.  

**Processfolio** A collection or documentation of an artwork/s throughout the stages of the artistic development. A processfolio shows the progression of artwork from conception to completion.

**Techniques** The use of tools and materials in unique ways that are specific to the artist, the medium, or the art form. Abstract expressionist painters, for example, often use palette knives or tools intended for the application of cement or putty to apply thick layers of paint to canvas.  

**Theme** Broad central idea. Examples include “identity,” “mankind’s relationship to nature,” and “change.” In the arts, a theme is a broad idea or a message conveyed by a work, such as a performance, a painting, a motion picture, or a video game. This message is usually about issues of life, society or human nature. Themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(arts)  

**Visual Literacy** The ability to interpret and make meaning from information presented in the form of an image.  

**Voice (Artistic)** A particular opinion, attitude, or style expressed in artistic form (2D, 3D) or to visualize; to create a mental image of.
