#### South Carolina College- and Career-Ready Standards for Media Arts Proficiency

## Introduction 

Education systems in the United States have long recognized the need for national standards to provide the basis for a common curriculum and academic programs throughout the country. The South Carolina academic standards for Media Arts are emerging to new levels in South Carolina’s academic standards for the Visual and Performing Arts. Studies in Media Arts utilize many of the elements and principles from other arts disciplines while creating a body of work that reflects its own list of developing elements and principles. Original media artworks reflect the aesthetics that are embedded in the visual and performing arts.  

Our students are increasingly using media as a source of communication and networking. It is imperative that our educational system and its constituents remain current with the trends and technologies that accompany the use of media. This includes appropriate use of media and the ability to interpret Media Arts productions both socially and professionally to nurture the 21st century learner. The new 21st century skills movement (www.21stcenturyskills.org) specifically references media literacy as one of the skills all students need to be attractive to employers in this new century. This also aligns with the skills for the South Carolina profile of the high school graduate. Teachers should understand that these standards need to be reinforced throughout these proficiency levels as the students use more advanced tools and media applications as well as more complex terminology and concepts.  

Studies in Media Arts function as a components of an overall school curriculum that addresses the role of diversity role in the classroom. Therefore, a school’s Media Arts curriculum should include sequential Media Arts courses as well as specialized courses. Media Arts can include courses in animation; film studies; graphic design; sound design and recording; digital photography; digital painting/illustration; and social media/web presence. Programs of study are designed to expose the student to a variety of future career opportunities while making them globally aware of the importance that Media Arts plays in the classroom and beyond.
