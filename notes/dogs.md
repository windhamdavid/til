## About

**23.01.09** - Just needed a place to put some notes on dogs since we're adopting a new puppy this spring and I'd like to learn as much as I can about training and care. Since the better half works in special education, we're going to get the dog certified as a service animal so that we may take her to schools to work with kids. wrote a post about her @ <https://davidawindham.com/iris/>

**23.06.20** - I moved the Iris specific info over to [another page](dogs/iris.md) so that I can just use this one for more general information about dogs.
