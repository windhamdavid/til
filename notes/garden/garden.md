# Garden

I enjoy gardening and yard work. I sometimes call this document site my little digital garden. I met my wife in a History of Landscape Design class while in college. We just started watching [Gardeners World](/posts/gardeners-world/) and I've got a lot of time outside with [Iris](/notes/dogs). I've always got some kind of yard project going on, so I'm going to leave this page here as a place to make notes.

## Log

- 23.05.23 - [Oak tree removed](/posts/white-oak)

## Notes

**24/04/02** - Since Iris has been tearing up and making trails in the yard, I've been thinking about switching out part of it to more wild grasses ( and weeds ðŸ˜‚ ). More of a Laissez-Faire Meadow[^1] since I manually pick some of the weeds. 

**23/05/23** - After watching Gardeners' World and realized that I don't know half of the plants that are planted in the beds. I started mapping out our yard to label the tree types, called in a tree guy to look at one of the oaks, ordered new sheers, gloves, and trays.
