# Garden

I enjoy gardening and yard work. I sometimes call this document site my little digital garden. I met my wife in a History of Landscape Design class while in college. We just started watching [Gardeners World](/posts/gardeners-world/) and I've got a lot of time outside with [Iris](/notes/dogs). I've always got some kind of yard project going on, so I'm going to leave this page here as a place to make notes.

## Log

- 25/05/07 - talked with some landscape guys about [chemicals](#chemicals)
- 25/05/01 - engaged landscape architect re: irrigation and sod
- 25/03/25 - removed three (3) pines and an additional oak close to the house
- 24/09/28 - lost a hickory and an oak tree during [helene](/notes/house/helene.md)
- 24/04/30 - added [pests](#pests)
- 23/05/23 - [oak tree removed](/posts/white-oak)

## Notes

**24/04/39** - we noticed the first flea of the season. Adding [pests](#pests) to the TOC here to keep notes. Going to try using nematodes this year since the diatomaceous earth tends to get wet in our humid environment too quickly.

**24/04/02** - Since Iris has been tearing up and making trails in the yard, I've been thinking about switching out part of it to more wild grasses ( and weeds ðŸ˜‚ ). More of a Laissez-Faire Meadow[^1] since I manually pick some of the weeds. 

**23/05/23** - After watching Gardeners' World and realized that I don't know half of the plants that are planted in the beds. I started mapping out our yard to label the tree types, called in a tree guy to look at one of the oaks, ordered new sheers, gloves, and trays.

## Lawn

### Grass

This is a sticky subject between my wife and myself. I'd prefer a lush barefoot St. Augustine lawn, but since we don't use chemicals, it's pretty tricky. White clover, crabgrass, dandelion, goosegrass, spurge, chickweed, quackgrass, buckhorn, sedge... we got em all. Trying to minimize the yard size to minimize the yard work. I just need a space big enough as far as I can throw a ball for the mut.

### Moss


## Beds

I built several raised garden beds in the middle of our front lawn which I keep a variety of plants going. Sometimes I plant a bunch of summer vegetables, but it's mostly herbs and flowers.

## Pests

### Chemicals

- Bifenthrin - to treat mulch and yard for ants and fleas [link](https://www.amazon.com/Bifenthrin-7-9-generic-Talstar-Gallon/dp/B00DGUY2LO/)
- Relegate - keep back undergrowth and can mix with others for smaller weeds.
[link](https://www.amazon.com/Relegate-Herbicide-Gallon-61-Triclopyr/dp/B09MGGN6CM)

### Bugs

The only two pests we've had issues with are ants and fleas. Lavender, cedar, clove, peppermint, Eucalyptus oils act as repellents. We use a good bit of cedar mulch and I've used clove oil spray. Rosemary, lemongrass, basil, mint, catnip, sage, Chrysanthemums, wormwood, and marigolds are also deterrents. 

Nematodes - have ordered some nematodes to try this year.

### Weeds

I try to let native plants run and I generally refer to the [USDA Invasive Species Information Center](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/). I just go after the one's that tend to be invasive or have cause pain. I call it plant racism, but I also don't like using the nationality names on the plants because I think that's a bit racist. These are the ones I'm pulling, cutting, and digging out:

- Poison Ivy - [Toxicodendron radicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_ivy)
- Autumn Olive - [Elaeagnus umbellata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaeagnus_umbellata)
- Privet - [Lugustrum sinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligustrum_sinense)
- Stiltgrass - [Microstegium vimineum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstegium_vimineum)
- Creeping thistle - [Cirsium arvense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirsium_arvense)
- Ivy - [Hedera helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedera_helix) ( my neighbor has let it overrun their yard )
- Virginia creeper - [Parthenocissus quinquefolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocissus_quinquefolia) ( not invasive or non-native, but I don't like it )
