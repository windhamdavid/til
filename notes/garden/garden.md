# Garden

I enjoy gardening and yard work. I sometimes call this document site my little digital garden. I met my wife in a History of Landscape Design class while in college. We just started watching [Gardeners World](/posts/gardeners-world/) and I've got a lot of time outside with [Iris](/notes/dogs). I've always got some kind of yard project going on, so I'm going to leave this page here as a place to make notes.

## Notes

**23/05/23** - After watching Gardeners' World and realized that I don't know half of the plants that are planted in the beds. I started mapping out our yard to label the tree types, called in a tree guy to look at one of the oaks, ordered new sheers, gloves, and trays.
