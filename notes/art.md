# Art

I graduated from college with degrees in studio art and art history. I haven't spent much time focusing on it since then, but I've told myself I would in retirement. I'm leaving this note here to document the process.  

There are several things I'd like to give a shot:  
- painting portraits and landscapes in oil and watercolor.  
- creating short films both animated and real.
- learning to play jazz standards and the American Songbook on piano
