  - As of February, 2017, you can boot your Linode using your choice of Linode's own kernel or the upstream kernel provided by a distribution's maintainers. Booting with Linode's kernel is enabled by default, but changing to the distro-supplied kernel is easy. This is useful if you'd like to enable specific kernel features, or if you'd prefer to handle kernel upgrades yourself.
