#Editors

A quick glance of the dotfiles in the home directory on a couple machines are what I generally reference.   [https://github.com/windhamdavid/dotfiles/](https://github.com/windhamdavid/dotfiles/)

The terminals and editors:  
* [atom](atom.md)
* [textmate](textmate.md)
* [terminal](terminal.md)
* [vi](vi.md)
* [zsh](zsh.md)

#### Commands
For each page I'll just put a list of commands I use and tend to forget.
