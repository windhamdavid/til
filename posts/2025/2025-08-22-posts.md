Today I learned that Jodie Foster wrote her thesis at Yale on Toni Morrison under the guidance of Henry Louis Gates Jr..

<!-- truncate -->

I also learned that Cherie Currie, the lead singer of The Runaways is who played alongside Jodie Foster[^1] in _Foxes_[^2]. That's a whole other story in and of itself. The reason for this discovery is a short film called _The Was_[^3]. It features 150+ films and I watch return to it every so often just to see if I can catch something new. I'm a big fan of both plunderphonics[^4] and video collages. The audio here from The Avalanches also uses hundreds if not thousands of samples. This one is pretty serious and the references are mostly right in my wheelhouse. I had to go digging for the scene of Jodie Foster eating chips though which is how this came about.

Here's a clip that contains the _Foxes_ scene which opens with Steve Martin in _The Jerk_ and closes with Bill Murray in _Groundhog Day_.

You can give the whole thing a whirl at [vimeo.com/176637319](https://vimeo.com/176637319). I originally bookmarked it almost ten years ago. Every so often I have to load up my favorites to find a reference and I inevitably end up watching _The Was_ again. 

Here's an incomplete list of the references in the short film. Someone else compiled it and I've noticed that several are missing... like an audio clip from _Pump Up the Volume_ in the clip above.
