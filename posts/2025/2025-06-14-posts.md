Today I learned that there **are** cars that are just too fast for me. 

<!-- truncate -->



A buddy of mine invited us to drive some cars to a show. His father collects and races of Porsches. He's got some other exotic sports cars like Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and MacLaurens as well, but it's mostly Porsches. His garage was lined with racing photos and trophies. He's German and told me that he started racing at age 52 with a Porsche 914. Twenty years ago he won the Sebring Enduro in a 930 at age 62. 

He currently has nine Porsches in his collection now including a Carrera GT and a three other GTs. There's nothing slack about any of em. He put the better half in a LE Turbo S Cabriolet and asked me which one I wanted to drive. I responded with 'the fastest' which I had thought would be the GT3 Weissach, but they put me in the GT2 RS. Handed me the key, showed me how to crank it and gave me a somewhat stern "you gotta watch this one, it'll get away from you" before we got rolling.

I'm not exactly timid when it comes to driving, but I was a bit concerned knowing it's a half a million dollar car that I'm pretty sure my insurance wasn't going to cover. I know em well enough but not that well. I felt it out for a bit and then hit it about ten minutes in and quickly realized this wasn't the type of model to just grab the wheel and put your foot down. It's absolutely insane that it's on the road and should require a different license. 

So yes, there is a car that is too fast for me. There's some sorta magic keeping the rear wheels on the ground and the transmission not ripping the gears apart. I actually asked to take a slower car home. I took the Dakar because I was courious and knew it would give me all wheel drive. I raced it alongside the Speedster and to be honest, several seconds to 100mph is still a race car.

There are so few of these cars that I was just glad for the opportunity and hopefully I made the drivers list for the next show. I later learned that this particular model[^1] is holding down a vast majority of the track records including the Nürburgring[^2]. After I mentioned that my first car was a Porsche and that I'm currently the age he started racing, I asked him if he'd coach me.
