Today I learned that Typepad is shutting down. 

<!-- truncate -->

I just wanted to take a moment to memorialize Typepad[^1] since it's shutting down at the end of this month. It was one of the first. I set up my account twenty some years ago and I remember the enthusiasm folks had for the internet. It mighta still been in beta because it's documented as having been launched in 2003. Although it ended up being the preferred medium of most large media companies, I think it's important to remember that it was build primarily as a way for a gal to publish a sewing blog[^2].
