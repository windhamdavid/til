Today I Learned about William Windham. 

<!-- truncate -->

I had already known a bit for quite some time but I shared the conjoined images on a text thread with friends and I just wanted to put it here for posterity.

The fella on the left is my dad from a couple years back and on the right is William Windham from around 1770 [^1]. The first time I saw this, I immediately recognized the similarities. About ten years ago after buying myself and my parents genetic testing kits. I got an email from a fella who ran a geneology group and offered to do an ancestor chart in exchange. Evidently dad's side goes back to a kid who got sent over in 1643 and his family property is a combination of a grant from King Charles II and a Governors grant for a revolutionary war hero Amos Windham[^2].
