Today I learned how to control Logic Pro with an Arturia keyboard. I spent hours last night going through hundreds of instruments and getting my hands and fingers accustomed to the keyboard and controls.

After I got it set up and comfortable, I ended up playing along to instructional videos[^1] for hours. I knew immediately that it was a good move because I wasn't working or adrift on the information highway. I promised myself I'd learn piano at some point and I included a drawer that would hold a keyboard for my new desk setup. Part of the reasoning is that I've finally integrated a high fidelity audio into my desk. I previously used a set of desktop Klipsch monitors and a sub so that the audio was good, but now I'm running everything through a dedicated amplifier with even higher studio quality monitors. Now that I'm back in business with my new studio[^2], it was only appropriate. 

I decided on getting a DAW[^3] so it's multi-functional. For the last six months, I've been debating various keyboard setups. At one point, I had decided on a Nord but the four thousand dollar price tag wasn't exactly sliding into my budget after the cabinet construction and computer upgrades. I decided on a Arturia[^4] KeyLab because of the libraries of instruments and the controls integrate easily with Logic Pro[^5]. By all considerations, I'm a beginner and I only had a couple years of lessons when I was young. I can still sheet read music, but just barely. After my music brain and fingers up to speed, I'll consider the extra octave and fully weighted keys. 



As is now a seemingly fundamental part of shopping, I reviewed a ton of reviews and what really stood out where the keyboard enthusiast comparing the sound libraries to the original instruments. Similar reviews of head to head of Yamaha, Korg, Roland, &  Nord showdowns for the best Hammond B3 with a Leslie cabinet. With Arturia, the libraries are on my computer instead of the device which makes perfect sense given my computer is much more powerful than the processors in any keyboard. I've literally got hundreds of vintage instruments at my fingertips that I can load directly into Logic Pro. The only two I added on are a wider assortment of pianos and Stage 73[^6] for the Fender Rhodes[^7] pedals and customization.

My original intent in relearning is that I'd like to learn to play some jazz standards. I guess I'll have to listen to every episode of Marriane McPhartland's _Piano Jazz_[^8] and practice every night for hours if I ever want to try and play even somewhat similar to Bill Evans[^9].
