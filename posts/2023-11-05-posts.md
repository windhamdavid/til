Today I learned Cat Power wrote her album Moon Pix in Prosperity, South Carolina<sub>1,2</sub>, William Eggleston had the same doctor as Elvis, and Dr. Nic from The Simpsons is based on him. While digging into Chan's most recent release of live Dylan covers, I decided to do the deep dive and learned all these in one swipe.

It might have been the fact that I like Dylan so much, but the live performance is stellar regardless<sub>3</sub>. Her interpretations are both original and sincere. I think part of the reason it resonated is that she's about my age and seems to have the same artistic bent. I read a bunch of old and new interviews. She grew up in Hotlanta, listed to soul and classic, went emo and punk as a teen and came back around to folk. I think I first heard a track from her on KCRW at some point and kinda blew it off, but I later realized I'd heard her previously. She recorded her first album in 1995, she'd been on Letterman a couple times during the mid 2000s. I also learned that she filmed a music video in 2006 with William Eggleston üëáüèº

I'm not sure who's house that is, but it certainly looks like his. Alongside of William Eggleston, Chan has also had her trials with booze, so the video fits. In the process of reading an interview with Eggleston, I learned that he had the same doctor as Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis who was the inspiration for Dr. Nic on _The Simpsons_ <sub>5</sub>. All this aside, I think the new album from Cat Power is sincere because she seems to have walked the talk.
