Today I learned why the iPhone 12 HDR setting has blown/washed out video color in Adobe Premier Pro. I mostly prefer to leave the High Dynamic Range enabled on video for my phone so I leave the setting on. It was especially noticeable while uploading some footage of [Iris](/notes/dogs) in the pond <sub>1,2</sub>.

<!--truncate-->

Adobe used to try to map HDR color into Rec. 709 color space. but now they've added a couple settings to handle them. The newer iPhone is recognizing the color space as Req 2100 HLG which is not a bug. There are some options for recognizing HDR now by changing a couple of default settings and/or adding a custom LUT<sub>3</sub>. There is a beta feature coming to automatically tone map the media<sub>3</sub>.

- Settings > General > Enable > 
  - Extended dynamic range monitoring.
  - Display Color Management
- Source Panel > Option Click source > Modify > Interpret Footage 
  - Color Management Input LUT: ( custom Lookup Table file )
  - Color Space Overide Rec 2020/2100
  - (beta) Working Color Space - Automatically Tone Map Media
