Today I learned that Dave Cobb went to a school for students with disabilities<sub>1</sub>.  I did the deep dive on him this morning because I listened to a _Broken Record_ podcast<sub>2</sub> at the request of a friend in a group thread and because I like his work. I wrote a response to my buddy who suggested it and I'm sharing it here because I think it's interesting.

<!--truncate-->

My first comment back to my friend was wondering what his special education diagnosis was. I suspect Autism spectrum because I think he may have to do with his sensitive ear ( Dave, if you're reading this, just email me ). Although he plays up the small town 'Church of God' soul thing, his parents were relatively well off and he went to an expensive private school in Atlanta. His mom died last year and was into interior design, art, and antiques which I think may give a better insight into the family life<sub>3</sub>. His mom's mother is who was involved in the church, studied music and learned to license church music. She's looks typical southern tough though and was likely the largest influence on his career<sub>4</sub>.

Given his history, you'd think he'd cite Little Richard because of his Pentecostal association. And in that vain, it's kinda apropos that he did the Elvis soundtrack. And even though his grandmother was over in Hinesville, he should also be citing Johnny Mercer and Billy Ward, who combined with Little Richard were three of the most important American musicians ever. Instead he likes to cite White Mansions, which in my opinion is a pretty hokey take on post civil war south written by an Englishman<sub>5</sub>.

But overall, Dave seems has a really good soulful ear, a good sense of taste, and is a nice guy.. which alongside of the timing of our collective cultural subconscious and a bit of luck is how is got to where he is now. When Sturgill's second album came out, I knew he was on to something given the throwback sound and that's when I first noted Cobb. The rest is pretty systematic. Stapleton, Carlile and Isbell would be famous regardless. I do like that he used the word LowCountry in his imprint and I think his legacy is kinda reviving the 'outlaw' country sound that may have a lot to do with his kinship with Shooter Jennings.

And since Dave likes to mention his affinity for fine wine, I spent some time in Nashville when a chef I worked for in Charleston wanted me to setup a wine program at a new place he opened there. It's a lot more sophisticated than anyone likes to give on... half of em are NYC and LA relocates who are capitalizing on the seemingly simpleton culture. In some ways, I'm willing to acknowledge my own background as the root of my penchant for his more sophisticated sound. But there is a part of me that knows it's kinda kitsch and it's redneck hip hop artist like Bubba Sparxx who are more representative of Nashville and in touch with the real modern low-brow outlaw southern culture<sub>6</sub>.

And regarding our digital vs. Analog discussion... this interview says he's recording about 70% analog especially for the vocals<sub>7</sub>. "But, you know, I can record something digitally, and I can record the same thing analogue, and it may be pitchy on both, but for some reason on analogue it doesn't bother me. I don't know why that is. There's just something about it." He's using a a Studer A820 24 track and a Burl Mothership 24-channel converter at the RCA studio. He cites digital for a big sound though saying "And now, with digital, we have the ability to preserve that first master sound, and then overdub on it, without ever losing that first-pass sound. I guess that's why I like digital." He sold his house in Nashville last year and some photos of his home studio are available<sub>8</sub>.
