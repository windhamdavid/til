Today I learned that you can sync dotfiles to Github Codespaces.

<!--truncate-->

I generally start my mornings off with a cup of ‚òïÔ∏è coffee and crank up the üíª machines. I get up early and I usually get my best work done in the mornings because it's quiet and relatively distraction free. Because we're staying downstairs during [our renovations](/notes/house)[^1], my office is upstairs, and the den has been cozy in the morning due to the fireplace, I've been starting off on my iPad üì± I nicknamed [Lisa](/docs/computers/lisa)[^2].

I try not to waste my caffeine boost üöÄ on reading the news, my messages or emails. Every afternoon before I cut loose from my desk, I generally try to close down everything except whatever projects I have going on so that I can pick right up on them in the mornings. I closely guard my attention likely because it'll easily skip off the rails and I wrote about this in [_Slow Thinking_](https://davidawindham.com/slow-thinking/)[^3]. And I've been slowly whittling my iPad into shape for more development and less communication which primarily revolves around [working with VS Code](/posts/vscode-ipad)[^4].

Yeah, I know... don't ask me "where I've been", I'm a [late adopter](https://davidawindham.com/late-adopter/)[^5]. I had barely touched the surface with CodeSpaces[^5] or Development Containers[^6] but I got a little OCD this morning over my terminal theme in a codespace and started digging into the configurations. Whatayaknow... turns out, I can just sync all of my configurations for the editor, terminal[^7], and development environment[^8]. Github and Microsoft have introduced an open specifications[^9]. 

Although I knew it was possible, I just hadn't spent much time doing it. I guess it's appropriate given my biggest time waster until now, [_The Simpsons Tapped Out_](https://davidawindham.com/the-simpsons/)[^10], is being deprecated so I guess I'll never finish my monorail.
