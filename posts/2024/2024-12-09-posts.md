Today I learned how to publish VSCode Extensions.

<!-- truncate -->

As is often the case, I was just trying to sync up my environments so that I could work seemlessly between the desk and couch when I wound up down the rabbit hole of typescript errors and configuration. Years ago I modified an exsiting extension so that I could more easily reference Wikpedia pages without having to leap between the browser and editor.

I noticed that when starting to sync my codespaces that I didn't have access to the extension which is when I remembered that it's only at my desk. So I whipped it into shape an published it on the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace[^1][^2] so that I'd have it available everywhere.

It works like this...  let's say [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) - I just highlight the word and hit a keyboard shortcut to automatically look it up and link to it. It uses the Wikipedia Search API for the lookup and sometimes I just use it for note taking. When I'm unsure of the meaning or history of something, I'll draft it in as a link so that I can reference it later.
