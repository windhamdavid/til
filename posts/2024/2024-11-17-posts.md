Today I learned that my dog can run 33mph.

<!--truncate-->

I like to run my dog [Iris](/notes/dogs/iris) but I don't like to run. I started running her alongside of my bike at soon as I was very confident in recall because of the danger of cars. Luckily I leave at the intersection of two cul-de-sacs and it's quiet a good bit. It started because I have a neighbor who runs his dog on rides and now we take em out together. Iris loves to run and the bike is the only way I can keep up. It's a daily pastime now.

I slowed this video 👇🏼 down 50% so you can see her strides.

We've got certain spots on the ride where we race. You can see her pace at the end of this video running up into the back yard.
