Today I learned that my work slows down when the weather is nice. As the heat has come on pretty quickly here in June, I noticed that I'm more eager to spend time at my desk.

It's pretty apparent in my git commit logs. I went back through the last five to take a look and sho'nuff... I slack off during good weather. If I broke em down by time, I'd likely see afternoon commits in the summer and morning commits in the winter months. I like to say we have six months of great weather here in South Carolina - March, April, May, September, October, and November. The other six months are a bit too hot or cold... or perhaps I've just grown accustomed to the relatively mild weather we have year-round.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to control the timing on requests and projects that come in, but I can schedule them in such a way to try and capitalize on the weather. I've also noticed that there are certain times of the year when there are more work requests... taxes, end-of-year accounting, near board meetings, and other seasonal effects on the economy like when real estate ticks up in summer and retail ticks up in late fall. People are also generally affected by the weather in ways we might not be aware of. I've noticed that a brewing storm, heat wave, or cold front will kinda send folks into a tizzy which will sometimes equate to work or just a frenzy of emails.

I like to try and plan my biggest projects nearest to July-Aug or Jan-Feb so I'm sitting inside when I should be. I don't seem to mind endless hours of computing then, but it's hard to forego a walk with my dog, gardening, a tennis match, or just a nap in the hammock when it's nice outside. At some point, I could try the migratory thing, but I'm pretty happy with six months of work and six months of good weather.
