Today I learned that Apple responds to product feedback. While playing tennis this morning we noted the brutal temps and it somehow fell into a discussion on climate change. The exact quote I got was that "it's all propaganda". I'm a big advocate for leaving politics, religion, cell phones, and whatnot off the courts, so I told em I'd reply with a text message later. So here it is... please ignore the profanity, but I wanted it to be honest since this was a conversation between friends.
