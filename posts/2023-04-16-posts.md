Today I learned how the South Carolina Department of Education publishes their Standards. Someone recently asked me if I was interested in substitute teaching at the high school or middle school levels, so I figured I'd go investigate what the standards are in the subject areas I'd be ok teaching.

Since I have a degree in studio art, I started with the South Carolina College- and Career-Ready Standards for Visual and Performing Arts Proficiency <sub>1</sub>.  I took the PDFs and exported them into Markdown so I could combine all of the various tables into single pages. Since I'm talking about communication design, I should note that I managed to **combine 153 pages into just 3.**. I've published them @ [Visual](/notes/art/visual), [Design](/notes/art/design), & [Media Arts](/notes/art/media). <sub>2,3,4</sub> This way I can just use search and ChatGPT to answer questions about the standards.

Perhaps I'll go back in and do computer science at some point, but I think it'd be much more fun to teach art. And If I ever decide I want to 'retire' from the computer screens, I'd need to be certified to teach full time. <sub>5,6</sub>. I just logged into the South Carolina Educators portal and I see that I already passed the subject area examination. I had forgotten because it was almost 20 years ago, but it's funny how everything circles around.

Perhaps I'll have a go at it someday. I think it could be fun and rewarding. It'd certainly get me away from the computer screens for part of the day, I could combine some of my more recent computer skills, and it would force me to practice art.
