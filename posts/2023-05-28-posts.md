Today I learned about the I.D. Buzz and Electric Mini release dates<sub>1,2</sub>. In an effort to lobby the better half on our future automobile lineup, I created the graphic below and added the dogs for better effect.

It seems like a good two car combo and I like the colors. They project a bit of "not too serious and fun". We've had enough white, black, and grey cars <sub>2</sub>. It'll also be the first time we've gone completely electric sans the riding mower. Our 2014 BMW i3<sub>3</sub> is now ten years old and we've had exactly zero issues with it. It's the perfect townie given it's size and range. This combo would mean switching out the highway mobile for the Buzz and having a convertible for the townie. There is still no firm release date on an electric mini convertible. It'll also mean higher visibility in town since the cars are identifiable. Right now, the white X3 just kinda blends in but everyone knows the i3. We shall see... I'm mostly a late adopter but I think we might be ready to take the plunge on them by the time they get out on the road in 2024 and 2025.
