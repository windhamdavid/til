Today I learned that the Reagan had the largest number of criminal charges of any presidential administration. I actually learned it last night watching a George Carlin standup<sub>1</sub>, but I doubted it given the last administration and I had to double check the reference this evening<sub>2</sub>. Sure enough, ole' George was just shooting straight.

I've been researching a bit of stand up because I've been considering creating a comedy cookbook of sorts that, get this... is actually about cooking. And I should note to anyone reading this, that I don't use AI, spelling, or grammer checkers because I prefer it that way given that these are really just notes to myself.

The majority of Reagan's administration charges was due to selling weapons to Iran and funneling to the money, but there was also rigging HUD grants, illegal lobbying, bribes at the EPA and military branches, or the bail-out of the late 80s savings and loan crisis... which I should note was mostly democratic Senators<sub>3</sub>. Somehow during the 1980 presidential election debates, the briefing papers for Carter were acquired by Reagan's team. I had sorta heard about this back in March when the New York Times published _A Four-Decade Secret: One Man‚Äôs Story of Sabotaging Carter‚Äôs Re-election_ and I wrote about how in the 'October Surprise'<sub>4</sub> Iran held the hostages until Reagan was elected. I was far too young to understand any of this at the time, but I remember it. the timing and subsequent dealings were just far too coincidental. Here's a new clip from the election in 1981 üëáüèº

Although I've listened to Carlin joke about politics for years, I've never really checked the details on em until the internet was in the my palm of my hand. We had the _Class Clown_ album in our house growing up and I think I first paid attention to it in about fifth or sixth grade likely just because I liked the album title. Seven dirty words wasn't exactly suited for kids in elementary school, but it was pretty enlightening and I kept the album in my room from then on. The only comedy album I think I played more often was Steven Wright's _I Have a Pony_ <sub>6</sub>. This was all right about the time of the Iran Contra affair.  As I've gotten older, I have a greater respect because I think I understand more now.

Carlin's last published standup was released posthumously because it's titled _I Kinda Like It When a Lotta People Die_ and was an ill-timed performance on September 9th and 10th, 2001. He became the first posthumous recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in 2008. He subtitled the standup routine I watched last night as _Reagan's Gang, Church People and American Values_ which is the first bit from an HBO special run in August of 1988. George Carlin has almost as much rhythm as Gil Scott-Heron talking about Reagan in _B Movie_<sub>7</sub>. He mentioned this rhythm in a Jon Stewart interview citing his parent emphasis on language and grandfather's memorization of Shakespeare<sub>8</sub>. 

I like this clip üëáüèº because he juxtaposes the far right and left.

Another bit from last night was about banning toy guns, so I looked it up and voila, there it was. In 1988, a provision tucked into the Federal Energy Management Improvement Act (FEMIA), Pub. L. No. 100-615, ¬ß 4, 102 Stat. 3185, 3190 (Nov. 5, 1988). I'd take Carlin over Reagan at any imaginary dinner and it's not because of their values, but because one of them seems to be funny, smart, and a decent conversationalist. And since stumping season is almost upon us, I can't help but notice the talking heads falling flat with attempted one-liners. One of our current candidates is in it mainly because he couldn't take a joke<sub>10</sub>.

#### ‚ÄúNever underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.‚Äù - George Carlin

This got me to wondering if sense of humor is based on values or is it objectively universal. What makes it good? Isn't a comedy just theatre with happy endings. Aristotle taught that comedy was generally positive for society while Plato suggested that it is destruction to the self.<sub>11</sub> I sometimes bring up Saturday Night Live skits on the tennis court and I've noticed that some conversative folks are adverse to SNL because of bias? I see where there are some studies that suggest the conservative minded are less appreciative of both irony and exaggeration<sub>12</sub> which I think may hit at the heart of the matter because I have no way of objectively knowing if my tastes are related to my values other than reading other folks opinions on it. 

I read a bunch of essays this afternoon some of which take the subject pretty seriously. Carlin said in an interview in 1990 about Andrew Dice Clay ‚Äúthe thing that I find unusual, and it‚Äôs, you know, not a criticism so much, but his targets are underdogs. And comedy traditionally has picked on people in power, people who abuse their power. Women and gays and immigrants are kind of, to my way of thinking, underdogs."<sub>13</sub> The clip recently resurfaced related to Dave Chappelle dis'n on underdogs. 

This video clip üëáüèº is from George Carlin on Charlie Rose in 1996 where he summarizes some of his views on art, people, politics, and values.

It's a mature Carlin and I like how he emphasizes the key when talking about politics is that the key is laughing at our ourselves and squarely places the target on the 'we' as a group. So I think it's kinda a 'self punch' versus a 'punch up' or down.  In that regard both Aristotle and Plato were both right with opposing views. Carlin saying "I don't like political jokes" is like George Benard Shaw saying "My way of joking is to the tell the truth".  I use the 'punch up approach' enough so that it might be called a David and Goliath complex. I try to accompany it with plenty of self-deprecation, but I really prefer it when the punch line is about ourselves... everyone. Given the considerations here and our current political climate, I think we desperately need a healthy dose.

Personally, I think you're values only affect your taste in comedy if you can't laugh at yourself. I think the essence of good comedy is about laughing at ourselves and the best jokes are just truths that punch everyone. And the very best jokes not only punch everyone, they remain truthful over time.
