Today I learned why Nick Cave went to the king's coronation<sub>1</sub>. Nick wrote a very compelling letter in his _Red Hand Files_ about he we went<sub>2</sub> so I went trolling through some press and images from the event and thought these two juxtaposed one another somewhat appropriately.

Nick Cave and Princess Anne ‚òùüèº <sub>2,3</sub>

Nick writes:

>I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest.

The full letter is worth a read<sub>4</sub>. I'm a big fan of his writing and brutal honestly. I learn something new all the time and I think everyone should subscribe.
