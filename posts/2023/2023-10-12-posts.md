Today I learned about Evi Nemeth and the origin of phrase layer 8 error <sub>1,2</sub>. Layer 8 error is just another way of saying User error along the lines PICNIC ( "problem in chair, not in computer" ) or ID 10T ("idiot error"). Evi is credited with referring to the layers on top of the 7-layer OSI model of networking as People, Money, Government, and Politics. She was known as the matriarch of system administration because she authored the the most widely used Unix SysAdmin books, and created 25h Anniversary UNIX playing card set. Evi disappeared at sea in 2013.

As usually the case, I learned this in a round about way. I was responding to a text message about a dinner reservation over in the Pee Dee<sub>3</sub> when I wondered about the origin of the word and it's spelling. This lead me to the Lynches River's namesake<sub>4</sub>, an early signer of the declaration and the subsequent list of people who had mysteriously disappeared at sea<sub>5</sub>. 

I noticed that Evi is referenced giving the single finger salute in the cover illustrations for the _Unix & Linux System Administration Handbook (4th Edition)_ and then for the revised fifth edition, she's shown on a tropical island hoisting a toast.

The fifth edition opens with a _Tribute to Evi_ <sub>8</sub>. 

>Evi taught us much more than system administration. Even in her 70s, she ran circles around all of us. She was always the best at building a network, configuring a server, debugging a kernel, splitting wood, frying chicken, baking a quiche, or quaffing an occasional glass of wine. With Evi by your side, anything was achievable.

> It’s impossible to encapsulate all of Evi’s wisdom here, but these tenets have stuck with us:
- Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive.
- Be liberal in who you hire, but fire early.
- Don’t use weasel words.
- Undergraduates are the secret superpower.
- You can never use too much red ink.
- You don’t really understand something until you’ve implemented it.
- It’s always time for sushi.
- Be willing to try something twice.
- Always use sudo.

>We’re sure some readers will write in to ask what, exactly, some of the guidance above really means. We’ve left that as an exercise for the reader, as Evi would have. You can hear her behind you now, saying “Try it yourself. See how it works.”

>Smooth sailing, Evi. We miss you.

🥲 I love learning things like this because it's nice to connect with the seemingly dry information on a more personal level. I remember seeing this book the first time in the late 80s at Waldenbooks in the mall. Books like these and their illustrations made software and computers all seem like a game of sorts and it's an attitude I still try to keep towards development and system administration.
