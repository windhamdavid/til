Today I learned a decent approach to doing a multi-step migration from a static site to classic WordPress theme to a hybrid theme to a full site editing block theme.

I've been adding [documentation](/docs/host/WordPress-Block)[^1] along the way, but I wanted to add a post because part of the motivation for publicly publishing my documentation was because of a comment I ran across. Even though there are already thousands of resources and various opinions floating around, I try to always go directly to the source documentation. And since some of it wasn't completely up to date given the recent changes, I like to get out ahead of what's coming next by scanning the developers chat where I noticed this comment from the founder[^2]üëáüèº

When I complain to my wife that the internet has gotten 'dumber', I'm generally referring to the fact that the barrier to entry has been lowered. This is illustrated by things like users filling Github Issues with support requests which is likely what is being referenced in the comment above. Even the project I'm currently documenting exemplifies this because even after I give the users a full set of tools to control their website, I **know** that they'll be even more likely to contact me for support and edits. I just try to be helpful and instead of being jaded about it, I just have to remind myself of all of the generous folks I've run into along the way and that I too, was once 'that kid off the street'.
