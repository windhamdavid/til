Today I learned that Apple has an extensive library of forms for product feedback. Ever since the advent of the app store, I've had just one irritating complaint about it... and NO, it doesn't have anything to do with the fee structure, blocking of in-app charges, or the relatively tight technical guidelines because I'm OK with those. My only complaint is about the design.

The App Store is the only place that I ever see promotional items from Apple and it's pretty disappointing every time I see them. Here's what I'm taking about üëáüèº

I'm just trying to join a zoom call and I understand the need to have a place to promote various software, but I don't need to see them every time I'm just updating the software I already have. It'd be ok if I was on the app store home page searching for apps. Although I use my Apple devices for both work and entertainment, it makes them feel cheap. 

**The update screen should take up the entire page without leaving the trending or promoted apps within view**. That's it... so I put in a product feedback through their forms @ [https://www.apple.com/feedback/](https://www.apple.com/feedback/) for both the iPhone and iPad and although I'm sure it's thousands of requests deep, I'm likely not the only one who thinks this.
