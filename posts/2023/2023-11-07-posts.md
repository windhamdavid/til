Today I learned that Françoise Gilot painted almost daily until the age of 100<sub>1,2</sub>. Although Gilot was known partially for her romantic partnership with Pablo Picasso and marriage to Jonas Salk, she was also a very accomplished painter. I'm not a big fan of the majority of her artwork but I admire her effort.

Gilot's estimated body of work was around 2,000 paintings and 5,000 drawings<sub>3</sub>. She worked almost daily and sometimes as much as 20 hours a day. I admire that sort of work ethic and I have the opinion that luck is mostly just a game of mathematical odds. I think you'll find this in every successful practitioner of almost anything. 

I ran into this tidbit while researching various artist studios. I suppose since winter is coming on, I'm thinking more about indoor activities which started me in on the project of reworking the cabinetry for [my studio](/notes/house/studio)<sub>4</sub>. And since I've spent a bunch of time in the car recently thinking about my studio, I've also been thinking about it's purpose. I spend anywhere from three to ten hours a day at my desk in my office. Combining my office desk with a studio means I'll be introducing another set of tools at my table. Although I kinda enjoy being the master of none, I curious as to which will garner the most of my attention.
