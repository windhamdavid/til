Today I learned an easy way to to get rid of the 'Sign In with Google' prompt.

<!--truncate-->

I just got tired of clicking the `X` to close it when I'm browsing and for whatever reason, I decided I'd fix it this morning while scanning the news. It's pretty ubiquitous, but the two sites I regularly see it on are Zillow and Reddit. You can disable it if you stay signed into Google, but I don't even though I use regularly Google Workspace accounts in Chrome.

I generally do all my surfing in a Safari private tab with it's built in privacy controls for preventing cross-site tracking and hiding my IP address[^1]. I'm just not too hip on having my browsing history influence my results[^2]. And since I'm a fan of not using any third party anything, I started by trying to configure Apple ScreenTime using a content filter, but realized that would also stop me from accessing other Google Workspace features in other browsers.

The `Sign In with Google` feature is loaded into third party websites via into an `iframe` from `https://accounts.google.com/gsi/` by JavaScript. And because of this the CSS ID is identical for all of the websites which makes pretty easy to hide using a browser extension to run custom scripts. I installed the `userscipts` open source extension[^3] for Safari which allows me to enable the scripts per domain and added one line to it:

```css
#credential_picker_container { display:none !important; }
```

Anytime that that sign in pops up, I just enable the `userscript` for that domain. It'll cost me and additional click for a little while but will likely start saving me time after a week or so.
