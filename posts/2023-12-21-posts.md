Today I finalized a decent approach to doing a multi-step migration from a static site to classic WordPress theme to a hybrid theme to a full site editing block theme. 

<!--truncate-->

The notes I made along the way turned into this post so I figured I'd share for anyone interested in doing something similar. 

#### Static

The site was static because I like them. They're performant and easy to maintain. I've noticed that half of the sites I have running under a content management system rarely if ever have updates made to them.

```sh
┌── .configs
├── css/
│   ├── fonts/icons/
│   ├── library.css
│   ├── css.scss
│   ├── site.css
│   └── site.css.map
├── docs/
│   └── .pdf
├── js/
│   ├── library.js
│   ├── library.js.map
│   ├── scripts.js
│   ├── site.js
│   └── site.js.map
├── img/
├── index.html
├── gulpfile.js
├── package.json
├── robots.txt
└── sitemap.xml

```


#### Hybrid

The hybrid site has

```sh
┌── .configs
├── css/
│   ├── fonts/
├── docs/
├── js/
├── img/
├── index.html
├── gulpfile.js
├── package.json
├── robots.txt
├── sitemap.xml
└── style.css

```


#### Block with Full Site Editing

#### Aside

Because there are already thousand of mostly shite resources floating around, I had to mostly go directly to the source documention. And since I noticed that some of it wasn't completely up to date, I've been scanning the `#core-dev` chat and noticed this comment: 

>It has come to my attention that some work that should have happened in public was being done on private p2s and other mediums. I asked for this to to stop as soon as I was aware of it. More transparency and openness will follow. I know that building in public is a pain, "any kid off the street can leave their opinion," but that's what we do. I also used to be that kid off the street.
