Today I learned a decent approach to doing a multi-step migration from a static site to classic WordPress theme to a hybrid theme to a full site editing block theme.

<!--truncate-->

The notes I made along the way turned into this post so I figured I'd share for anyone interested in doing something similar. The existing site was static because I like them. They're performant and easy to maintain. I've noticed that half of the sites I have running under a content management system rarely if ever have updates or changes made to them. In that regard, I think it's just about control. 

## Setup

## Aside

Because there are already thousand of mostly shite resources floating around, I had to mostly go directly to the source documention. And since I noticed that some of it wasn't completely up to date, I've been scanning the `#core-dev` chat and noticed this comment: 

>It has come to my attention that some work that should have happened in public was being done on private p2s and other mediums. I asked for this to to stop as soon as I was aware of it. More transparency and openness will follow. 

>I know that building in public is a pain, "any kid off the street can leave their opinion," but that's what we do. I also used to be that kid off the street.
