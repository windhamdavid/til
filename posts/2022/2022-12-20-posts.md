Today I learned to use VSCode on my iPad. I just wanted to test out working in repos while I'm away from my laptop or desk because it's much easier traveling with my tablet.

Although I doubt I'd really prefer this small keyboard for any real work, It'll be nice knowing that I can if I needed. I've been carrying my laptop when I travel for years and it'd be nice to just leave it at home and know that I could reboot a server or an app. I could also make notes and make minor fixes.  

Things I'd need to make sure I have available my iPad. <sub>1,2</sub>. 

- sign into Github and hit (.) on the repo I need to open
- need to create a codespace to builds
- sftp /ssh client
- ssh keys? Terminus SSH allows for keys<sub>3</sub>
