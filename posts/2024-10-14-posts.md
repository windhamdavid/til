Today I learned that WordPress and WPEngine Are At It.

<!--truncate-->

I picked up on this spat catching up on my reader this morning. I read the lawsuit, read up on it a bit, and watched a couple interviews. It's not exactly your typical business spat and the part I find interesting is the relationship to open source software and the comment "How Private Equity Can Hollow out and Destroy Open Source Communities".

Let me first say, I'm just glad to not have been dragged into this sorta mess simply because I don't like to use third party code. I've got plenty of WordPress websites published with an assortment of custom fields which have all been built by yours truly.
