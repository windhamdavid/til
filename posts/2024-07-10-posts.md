Today I learned how to fix some seriously corrupted database tables in MariaDB.

<!--truncate-->

I had a serialized data issue with a search & replace script I use to migrate databases back and forth from staging servers, so I reverted to the command line to make the changes. As is usually the case when something breaks, I tend to take a break myself. I shut down the machine to walk the dog and when I booted back up, MariaDB wasn't starting. Originally thought it might be related to some sort of permissions issue with Homebrew so I checked my plist files and tried running them as sudo to no avail.

```sh
launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mariadb.plist
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mariadb.plist
```


I checked the logs @ `/opt/homebrew/var/mysql/ovid.local.err` and found:

```sh

```

At this point, I'm hitting stack overflow and trying to reverse-engineer my last steps. I start adding  in InnoDB recovery modes @ `/opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf'` and find that the only level that will start it up is `6`

```sh
innodb_force_recovery=6
```

This is the warning from the MySQL documentation for level `6`
> "This value can permanently corrupt data files. Leaves database pages in an obsolete state, which in turn may introduce more corruption into B-trees and other database structures. Sets InnoDB to read-only."

but I'm able to go ahead and run a full `mysqldump` coming in at a meager 18GB. Because I know this will be a process I let it rest for the evening knowing I'd be better off picking back up on it with a fresh cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è in the morning.

```

I crank up MySQL in recovery mode again to check this logs and I'm getting errors on the `hist_type` and `histogram` tables. 

```sh
2024-07-10  9:53:00 3 [ERROR] Incorrect definition of table mysql.column_stats: expected column 'hist_type' at position 9 to have type enum('SINGLE_PREC_HB','DOUBLE_PREC_HB','JSON_HB'), found type enum('SINGLE_PREC_HB','DOUBLE_PREC_HB').
2024-07-10  9:53:00 3 [ERROR] Incorrect definition of table mysql.column_stats: expected column 'histogram' at position 10 to have type longblob, found type varbinary(255).
```



I dug through a bit of documents to alter this tables but unfortunately I was only able to get it running in a read-only recovery mode and these wouldn't work. 

```sh
ALTER TABLE mysql.column_stats MODIFY histogram longblob;
ALTER TABLE mysql.column_stats MODIFY hist_type enum('SINGLE_PREC_HB','DOUBLE_PREC_HB','JSON_HB');
```

At this point I kinda knew the best option would be the ole' restart or reinstall. I decided to wipe it clean and reinstall MariaDB.

```

Once it was back up running, I checked all of the database tables for corruption but could find `NONE`. Perplexed, I restarted MariaDB a couple of times successfully and then I rebooted my computer and üí£ it blew out again with the same errors. I went on a deeper dive and found a similar error from another user which had a response from a MariaDB developer. I listened to a presentation by this person and then made the switch back over to MySQL 8.3. As much as I bemoan the Oracle acquisition of MySQL, it matches up with most remote servers and it certainly saved me some time migrating the database servers. 

```sh
brew remove mariadb
brew install mysql
brew services start mysql
sudo /opt/homebrew/bin/mysql_secure_installation
mysql -u root -p < /Users/david/Downloads/24.7_localhost.sql

//opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf
[mysqld]
collation_server = utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci
character_set_server = utf8mb4

utf8mb4_general_ci ( fastest )
utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci ( most accurate for multi language )
utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci ( specific to MySQL 8x)
```

Rebooted [Ovid üíª](/docs/computers/ovid) and all is well.

üî• NOTE: I should remember to do a little housecleaning more often though because I found some other loose ends in my homebrew packages. And this reminded me about every previous time I've had to debug an error with MySQL and about my favorite video on the topic üëáüèº
