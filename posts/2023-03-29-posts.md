Today I learned how to use OpenAI ChatGPT<sub>1</sub> to index my personal Today I learned documents.  After I got ChatGPT v4 API access, I applied it to my markdown documents to gave me semantic search capabilities and the ability to interact with the model within my own documentation. I've had a bunch of discussions recently about using it for various purposes and I've been exploring those.

<!--truncate-->

I used Github CoPilot<sub>2</sub> for a quite a while until I stopped using it once it went commercial. My morning coffee and dinner conversations have mainly revolved around possible real world usage with other data and not necessarily coding. I took the recent Khan Academy GPT based Khanmigo<sub>3</sub> bot for a spin and it completely convinced me of it's real potential. I've been relatively skeptical in my conversations about artificial intelligence but I was wrong. There, I said it...

We're in for some long term changes with how this technology is going to change a lot of things.  I've used the term '[Second Brain](https://davidawindham.com/a-second-brain/)'<sub>4</sub> to describe these TIL documents because it's really just another tool. The difference is that this tool is going to be much more easily used and customizable to a bunch of different applications. For instance: Your car already has machine readable codes that can diagnose and troubleshoot issues. The problem is that most people don't have the tool to plug into the car and even then don't have the reference for those codes. Semantic language search is going to help all of those other people who metaphorically don't have the code reader or a diagnostic reference. Medicine, education, law... etc. It's going to have an impact and I'm all in on it.

For now, I'm going to just test out using it against my own essays, notes, and documentation. Once I have my head properly wrapped around the possible hiccups, I'll start building it into documentation for other businesses and projects when useful. I originally wrote an essay on Artificial Intelligence<sub>5</sub> and I'm adding a more detailed essay @ <https://davidawindham.com/artificial-intelligence-2/> <sub>6</sub>
