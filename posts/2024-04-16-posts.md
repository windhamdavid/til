Today I learned that my uncle Woody died.

<!--truncate-->

1940 - 2024 83 years

I like reflecting on folks lives when they die and I've found that writing out a personal obituary of sorts is a great process for doing so[^1].

The reason Woody was in radio is, as he explained to me, he walked from middle school to sneak into the filming of American Bandstand where met Dick Clark in the late 50s. Granddad was stationed there as a medic for the US Navy. My cousins and his older sister, my aunt Mary, stayed in Philly when Grandad moved the family to Charleston. Woody went to Charleston High School where he worked night shifts at "The Goodie House" which was a 24hr restaurant downtown that I also frequented when I was at CofC. It was at that job where that Woody became interested in all things fun with the late-night crowd... hence the name Woody with the Goodies. It was a fella he met there named George Buck who got him involved with radio at WCOS in Columbia where he started hosting American BandStand style 'hops', converted the format to Rock 'n Roll, and brought dad onboard while he was at USC in the late 60s. 

When the local teen dance program went national on ABC in 1957 it was rebranded American Bandstand. By then, the show’s original host, Bob Horn, had been replaced by the younger, cleaner cut Dick Clark. WFIL was built by Walter Annenberg’s Triangle Publications and was the first TV studio in the nation constructed for the purpose of television broadcasting, as opposed to adapting a preexisting structure.

George Buck created nine record labels and started a foundation for his love of Jazz music. This is him -

The connection to the Shag comes from a small juke joint in Columbia where the Big Apple dance is thought to have originated. A professor from Cambridge University, Betty Wood, who was studying the history of slavery in South Carolina saw this dance and started performing it at Myrtle Beach and was invited to perform it at the Roxy Theatre in New York leading to it's rise in popularity in radio/tv by Bob Hope, Jimmy Stewart, Mae West, and Ginger Rodgers

I got a couple text messages and emails from various folks about it  
I used to say "don't hold that against me" when discussing my relatives but the truth is that I'm very proud of the type of Windham personality traits.
