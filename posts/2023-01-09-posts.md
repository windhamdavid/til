Today I learned that a dog can use inference and learn 1000 words. Dr. [John W. Pilley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Pilley) was a professor of Psychology in South Carolina who taught his dog [Chaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaser_(dog)) and wrote a book on it.

üëâüèº I'm creating some notes over at [https://davidawindham.com/til/notes/dogs](/notes/dogs)<sub>4</sub> where I've referenced the training videos from Dr. Pilley.

I've been making some notes on dogs because we're getting another this spring. The last of our three dogs<sub>1</sub> passed last year at age 19<sub>2</sub>. And although we said we'd wait a couple of years, we've decided to get another dog this summer. I've been scrolling the regional human society websites for the last year or so keeping an eye out for an adoption. We were particularly fond of our previous Golden Retriever<sub>2</sub> so we also started looking at regional breeders and we finally picked one and joined a waiting list for a litter due in May. 

Since my better half works with kids with disabilities, we'd like to get the dog certified as a service animal so that we can work with kids so I've been doing some research.
