Today I learned that _Gardeners' World_ is on it's 54th season.  It first aired in 1968 on BBC Television <sub>1</sub>. We just started watching the series likely because of working on our garden and yard. 

<!--truncate-->

I updated my Garden notes page <sub>2</sub> because I'm trying to remember the names of all of the plants. If I remember correctly from the episode last night, there are over 500 plant families and 300,000 species with millions named. I think I'll just shoot for learning all of the ones in my yard.  

After watching other folks tend to their gardens, I decided to order some new sheers and gloves yesterday.  I got poison ivy on my arm clearing out some natural area because I'm worried the new pup will get into everything. I'm meeting with a tree guy today about an unhealthy Oak. 

My father has about a quarter acre garden and the older I get the more I also just want to work in the yard. I know now that I've got plenty of seasons of _Gardeners' World_ and an almost endless amount of knowledge to keep me occupied.
