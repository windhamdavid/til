Today I learned that Donald Trump is the second US president to serve non-consecutive terms.

<!--truncate-->

Donald Trump[^1] is only the second to do so after Grover Cleveland[^2]. As is normally the case, I didn't read the news or stay up to watch the results come in. I fell asleep shortly after watching The Simpsons. I didn't vote for Trump but I'm also not completely doom and gloom on a second term. The good news is that we won't have a bunch of election conspiracy nuts storming any government buildings this go round or the continued rigged rhetoric. Although I don't have a lot of confidence in his leadership, I'll watch with bated anticipation to see how it all shakes out.

I mentioned to the better half over coffee this morning that it's good for our upcoming [home renovation](/notes/house)[^3] because our contractors, given their voting proclivity, will likely be in better state of mind moving onto the project. I'll be watching my investments a bit more closely which I had planned to do regardless of the outcome. We're kinda in that middle ground where the majority of policies wouldn't effect our bottom line but my wife does work with disadvantaged 

There are a lot of things I just don't like. I'm oh so tired of the hatred rhetoric, but I've got just enough confidence in our system to avoid a full on mess. I don't like the republican party's embrace of anti-this.that.or.another blaming everyone and thing from immigrants to atheist. I don't really think finger pointing is helpful in finding meaningful solutions and I am genuinely concerned for minorities populations be it political party, race, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation. I could go on here, but I think the apparent political divisiveness speaks loud enough for itself.

I think the long term outcome will be akin to what I wrote in the [_The Purple Party_](https://davidawindham.com/the-purple-party/)[^4]. The Simpsons _Treehouse of Horror XXXV_[^5] episode last night began with a bit entitled _The Information Rage_.

>During Mayor Quimby's meeting and the suggestion from Lisa, the town decided to deliver LED light bulbs to everyone. However, people start arguments over the political implications, and their anger leads to breaking open through the ocean floor. From the cracks, two kaiju beings, known as Red Monster and Blue Monster, each embodying the divergent perspectives that divide the townspeople. Additional monsters Four-chan Saurus, Facebookzilla, Mecha-Reddit, and Ro-Gan appear. Professor Frink creates a robot controlled by Bart and Lisa to take on the creatures while advising the residents of Springfield to remain calm and to cease using social media to prevent the resurgence of the monsters.

Although not the election outcome I would have preferred, I'm not exactly surprised and I can try to see some positives. I'm hoping for civility moving on and I think the long term effect will start some much needed new dialogue in US politics. I'd like to see less polarization, perhaps some party shifts, and some needed practical discourse on our future. The protagonist is not always the hero, the antagonist drives the storyline on occasion, and sometimes the impetus for change is what you'd least expect.
