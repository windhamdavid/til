Today I learned that Dennis Ritchies Ph.D. thesis was never accepted and that his son created a game company called Binary Arts <sub>1,2</sub>.  The reason this was important to me is because I use Unix daily and had a collection of puzzles which included Spin-Out from Bill Ritchie's company.

Dennis Ritchie was the computer scientist who created the C programming language and the Unix operating system<sub>3</sub>. These two are the underpinnings of a vast majority of what computers today. I've been tinkering with a little side project based on puzzles that encourages curiosity in learning since I credit this quality for my own success. I'll start a page for that project over at [/notes/projects/games](/notes/projects/game)
