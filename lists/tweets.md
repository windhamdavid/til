# Tweets

I wrote an essay about this page at **[https://davidawindham.com/twitter](https://davidawindham.com/twitter)**. 

I mostly quit using Twitter and this is a list of my tweets ( [https://twitter.com/windhamdavid](https://twitter.com/windhamdavid) ) in chronological order starting with the first. I also made a list of the [people I followed](tweets_follow) so that I could pull most of them into another platform. 

According to my archive, over 15 years I had:  
**828** Tweets, **78** Likes, **88** Blocked accounts, & **3** Muted accounts.
