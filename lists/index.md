# Lists

#### A list of lists for non-technical stuff. 

This page was originally published at [https://davidawindham.com/listing-lists/](https://davidawindham.com/listing-lists/). It was inspired by the first awesome list that Sindre Sorhus created which you can read about on the original post. I'm using it as a place to keep some non-technical lists. I'm primarily using it to list my favorite artists, places, people, and things.
