### A list of lists of things I like. 

This page was originally ( [https://davidawindham.com/listing-lists/](https://davidawindham.com/listing-lists/) ) inspired by the list that Sindre Sorhus created which have now evolved into a library of useful resources available @ [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). The idea of keeping documentation in a version control repository is the way to go and I've moved this old repo into the TIL project to simplify. I've also added a 'now' or 'up next' page as a replacement for using bookmarks.
