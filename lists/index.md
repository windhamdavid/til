# Lists

#### A list of lists for non-technical stuff. 

This page was originally published at [https://davidawindham.com/listing-lists/](https://davidawindham.com/listing-lists/). It was inspired by the first awesome list that Sindre Sorhus created which you can read about on the original post. I'm using it as a place to keep some non-technical lists. I'm primarily using it to list my favorite artists, places, people, and things. 


I've moved this old repo into this TIL project to simplify. 

- 22.11 - Added [Music Playlists](art/music#playlists), a [feeds list](feeds), and my [tweeps](people)
- 22.04 - Added [Words](words), [Quotes](quotes), [Concepts](concepts), and [Trivia](trivia) based on other items added to my Today I learned index. 
- 22.07 - Added [Up next](next) page as a replacement for using my bookmarks site to keep up with my future attention.
