# Groceries

**23/05/24** - Groceries should be the mother of all lists given the fact that I, and most others, work from it weekly. We keep our grocery list in a shared Apple Notes file that syncs between devices and uses a checklist so that we don't have to add or remove items we buy regularly. We just add new items that haven't been on the list, tap a listed item to add, and tap again to remove. We've only been doing this consistently for about a year so there are items that have yet to be added and I would imagine that it'll grow considerably after a while.
