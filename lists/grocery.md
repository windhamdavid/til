# Groceries

**23/05/24** - Groceries should be the mother of all lists given the fact that I, and most others, work from it weekly. We keep our grocery list in a shared Apple Notes file that syncs between devices and uses a checklist so that we don't have to add or remove items we buy regularly. We just add new items that haven't been on the list, tap a listed item to add, and tap again to remove. We've been doing this consistently for about three years and the lists below are only in the order of when I made them. I wrote a [post about grocery lists](/posts/grocery-shopping) and I'll just update this every so often.

**23/12/08** - This is everything we've ever had on our Grocery list note since we started keeping it a couple years ago. The list moves checked items to the top of each section or subheading like 'Herbs' so I've reorganized them here base on what I think we buy most often. Sometimes the better half still makes written notes and it's usually just 'need' items.
