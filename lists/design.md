# Design

These are just some lists of design inspiration. I created it this morning after running into the [Mux](https://www.mux.com) site which I liked because of it's use of architectural and engineering'ish elements. I have a tendency to stick these in bookmarks or notes, but I always forget where I've listed them and so I have this list.
