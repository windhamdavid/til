# Music

## Playing

I took piano lessons for a number of years when I was younger but I can barely read sheet music now because I stopped playing. I've also learned to play guitar, bass, mandolin, violin, and a bit of trumpet and clarinet. At some point I might buy another keyboard because the better half and I have threatened to start our own band for fun. 

## Listening

I listen to quite a bit of music and I like all the kinds. I like to listen when I'm cooking, working, driving, washing the cars in the driveway, and sitting on the back porch. When I was a young, my father had a very large collection of albums so I got an early start. Although I was online at the time, I never personally used Napster or any Peer to Peer music sharing service. However, my friends would make me cds and share the mp3s on thumb drives so I also had a decent start on a digital collection too. I don't have a vinyl collection or frame albums because I'm not that hip. Streaming is the way for me and I use several services. I like to attend live music performances and discover new music so I try to keep up with new releases. I don't have any preferences for style excepting whatever mood or state of mind I may be in at the time. I think the key to good art, including music, is authenticity.



## Now

Since about 2011, I've tracked almost most all of my listening habits and I pull that information into a page on my personal website. If you want to see an overview of what I'm listening to [**right now**](https://davidawindham.com/studio/music) @ [https://davidawindham.com/studio/music](https://davidawindham.com/studio/music). I'd imagine that these lists will grow to the thousands of tracks, so I'm only adding favorite artists when I remind myself how much I enjoy their music and I'll go in and try to rank them at some point.  

## Playlists

I like to create music playlist from new releases about every month or so. I started doing it when I began to migrate my listening to streaming services. I usually just date them with the year and month.  I use [Last.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm) to keep tabs on what I listen to and I use [Exportify](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) to export from my Spotify playlists to convert to markdown. I sometimes run data analysis on them for fun.  I like to keep a copy of them here so that I can search for an artist or track I'm trying to think of.
