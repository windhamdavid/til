## Appliances 

I had a long bike ride discussion on kitchen appliances last night and I’ve got an essays worth of material now. I can’t really say anything  until it’s forgotten other than to let y’all know that it’s definitely not a keeper. I haven’t owned a microwave since 1991 so maybe my plastic consumption is lower than the average bloke. If you want an Amy’s burrito in my house you better start thinking about an hour in advance. 

Third world countertop cookware - a toaster oven with a fan. just marketing… that worked since 60% of U.S. households have one and 1 in 5 Brits say it’s their most common cooking device.  It’s not healthier. that’s entirely to do with the ingredients. If anything encourages quick crispy(oily) foods. I prefer my veggies steamed. It doesn’t brown (Maillard reaction) better than a convection. It’s just slightly faster. but you gotta weigh that against the counter space, fires, electrical shorts, and burns. It’s almost like the microwave trade-off, quicker but you’ll likely be melting plastic into your food and making poorer food choices. 

instapot is just a pressure cooker, rice is also a pressure, crock is just a ceramic on low heat, fryer is just a deep pot, etc. The guys that created Instapot worked at Blackberry and modeled it after popular Asian rice cookers. It was the #1 Amazon seller in 2016 but they filed bankruptcy last year to qualify for restructuring while air fryers took the top spots. 

countertop plugins in use: toaster, coffee maker, grinder, juicer, blender, mixer, processor… panini press is quicker for sandwiches but I’ll likely dump this one too even though it’s our second in favor of the classic heavy grill press you see at a diner. And since I don’t have a deep gas fired wok, the stovetop just doesn’t get the heat up the sides the way the electric wok does. And an everyone should have an air popper for popcorn. that’s 11 countertop appliances. that’s enough. 

we’ll be gifting the air fryer toaster oven in lieu of a double convection oven. haven’t had a microwave since 1991 and at this point it’s an ongoing conversation starter for us because most microwave’able food is pretty nasty and if your hungry… you better be dedicated because an Amy’s burrito will be 45 minutes in the oven.  Bread maker gifted away, crock moved to the office where it always was anyway - take it over in glass and dump it in. gifted the waffle maker, never had a deep fryer, gifted the espresso maker although I miss the milk steamer, never did the k-cups for coffee - slow drip, high heat, and no waste.  We’ll decided on getting rid of the old countertop grill in the kitchen in favor of more countertop, the outdoor ceramic smoker/grill and reworking the big exhaust vent back to the hood.
