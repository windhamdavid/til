# Thanksgiving 🦃

25/11/14 - hosting Thanksgiving this year so we've got the full menu on our plates. We usually have a couple goto dishes so I just figured I'd put all the ingredients and recipes here as a reference since I gotta pick em up next week. 

## Menu

Here's the full menu. Might notice there is no bird because they don't sit well with my dad. Plus even since I lost the opportunity to get the farm raised big organic gobblers I also kinda prefer a ham.

#### Carrots

- cooked with cinnamon and brown sugar

## Grocery List

So I don't forget anything.
