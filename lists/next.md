**22/07/06** - I added this page so that I could set reminders of shows, films, podcasts, games, and books I'd like to give me attention to because I'm often trying to remember what it was I wanted to watch on TV.  I wrote a post about it @ [https://davidawindham.com/now-streaming/](https://davidawindham.com/now-streaming/)

## Log

- 25/01/28 - keeping up with the current @ [/lists/now pages](/lists/now) & not keeping up with the finished one's so I've removed because anything really notable, I'd write about elsewhere.
- 24/11/14 - went looking for new shows and added recurring for easier reference but mainly just wanted to start a workflow using pulls since I'm using the ipad and vscode in github.dev.
- 23/05/22 - I've arranged the page so that after it's done, I move it to the bottom and rank it in order.
