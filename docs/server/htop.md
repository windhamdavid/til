#### **NAME**
```
       htop - interactive process viewer
```
#### **SYNOPSIS**
```
       **htop** **\[**\-dChusv\]
```
#### **DESCRIPTION**
```
       Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.

       It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so you can see
       all the processes running on the system, along with their full command lines, as  well  as
       viewing  them  as  a  process tree, selecting multiple processes and acting on them all at
       once.

       Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without entering their PIDs.
```

```
#### **INTERACTIVE** **COMMANDS**
```
       The following commands are supported while in htop:

       **Up,** **Alt-k**
            Select (highlight) the previous process in the  process  list.  Scroll  the  list  if
            necessary.

       **Down,** **Alt-j**
            Select  (highlight)  the  next  process  in  the  process  list.  Scroll  the list if
            necessary.

       **Left,** **Alt-h**
            Scroll the process list left.

       **Right,** **Alt-l**
            Scroll the process list right.

       **PgUp,** **PgDn**
            Scroll the process list up or down one window.

       **Home** Scroll to the top of the process list and select the first process.

       **End**  Scroll to the bottom of the process list and select the last process.

       **Ctrl-A,** **^**
            Scroll left to the beginning of the process entry (i.e. beginning of line).

       **Ctrl-E,** **$**
            Scroll right to the end of the process entry (i.e. end of line).

       **Space**
            Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes, like "kill",
            will  then  apply  over  the  list  of  tagged  processes,  instead  of the currently
            highlighted one.

       **U**    Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).

       **s**    Trace process system calls: if [strace](../man1/strace.1.html)(1) is installed, pressing this key will  attach
            it to the currently selected process, presenting a live update of system calls issued
            by the process.

       **l**    Display open files for a process: if [lsof](../man1/lsof.1.html)(1) is installed,  pressing  this  key  will
            display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.

       **F1,** **h,** **?**
            Go to the help screen

       **F2,** **S**
            Go  to  the  setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top of
            the screen, set various display options, choose among color schemes, and select which
            columns are displayed, in which order.

       **F3,** **/**
            Incrementally  search the command lines of all the displayed processes. The currently
            selected (highlighted) command will  update  as  you  type.  While  in  search  mode,
            pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences.

       **F4,** **\\**
            Incremental  process  filtering:  type  in  part  of  a process command line and only
            processes whose names match will be shown. To  cancel  filtering,  enter  the  Filter
            option again and press Esc.

       **F5,** **t**
            Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations between them as
            a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and your previously  selected  sort
            view. Selecting a sort view will exit tree view.

       **F6**   On  sorted  view,  select  a field for sorting, also accessible through < and >.  The
            current sort field is indicated by a highlight in the header.  On tree  view,  expand
            or  collapse  the current subtree. A "+" indicator in the tree node indicates that it
            is collapsed.

       **F7,** **\]**
            Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value).  This can only
            be done by the superuser.

       **F8,** **\[**
            Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)

       **F9,** **k**
            "Kill"  process:  sends  a  signal  which is selected in a menu, to one or a group of
            processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all  tagged  processes.   If
            none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.

       **F10,** **q**
            Quit

       **I**    Invert  the  sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and vice-
            versa.

       **+,** **\-** When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed a "+"
            sign shows to the left of the process name.

       **a** **(on** **multiprocessor** **machines)**
            Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.

       **u**    Show only processes owned by a specified user.

       **M**    Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).

       **P**    Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).

       **T**    Sort by time (top compatibility key).

       **F**    "Follow"  process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process to move in
            the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for monitoring a  process:
            this  way,  you  can  keep a process always visible on screen. When a movement key is
            used, "follow" loses effect.

       **K**    Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be displayed in  the
            process list. (This is a toggle key.)

       **H**    Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary processes
            (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from  userspace  processes
            in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)

       **p**    Show full paths to running programs, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)

       **Ctrl-L**
            Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.

       **Numbers**
            PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it.
```
#### **COLUMNS**
```
       The  following columns can display data about each process. A value of '-' in all the rows
       indicates that a column is unsupported on your system, or currently unimplemented in htop.

       **NICE** **(NI)**
            The nice value of a process, from 19 (low priority) to -20 (high  priority).  A  high
            value  means  the  process  is  being  nice,  letting  others  have a higher relative
            priority. The usual OS permission restrictions for adjusting priority apply.

       **STARTTIME** **(START)**

```
#### **CONFIG** **FILE**
```
       By  default htop reads its configuration from the XDG-compliant path [~/.config/htop/htoprc](file:~/.config/htop/htoprc)
       -- the configuration file is overwritten by htop's in-program Setup configuration,  so  it
       should  not be hand-edited. If no user configuration exists htop tries to read the system-
       wide configuration from /etc/htoprc and as a last resort, falls back  to  its  hard  coded
       defaults.

       You  may  override  the  location  of the configuration file using the $HTOPRC environment
       variable (so you can have multiple configurations for different machines  that  share  the
       same home directory, for example).
```
#### **MEMORY** **SIZES**
```
       Memory  sizes  in htop are displayed as they are in tools from the GNU Coreutils (when ran
       with the --human-readable option). This means that sizes are printed in  powers  of  1024.
       (e.g., 1023M = 1072693248 Bytes)

       The  decision  to  use this convention was made in order to conserve screen space and make
       memory size representations consistent throughout htop.
