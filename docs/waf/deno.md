# Deno

( **24/11/14** ) Deno is technically a JS/TS/WA runtime instead of a framework. I'm a big fan of the simple top down all-in-one approach. Although I've dabbled around with it previously, I'm **all in** after watching an interview with and by Ryan Dahl[^1][^2]. I haven't had enough time with Rust to have a solid opinion, so I have to trust the opinions of others I respect.
