# SupaBase

I mostly try to avoid SaaS unless they can do a much better job than I can for cheaper. I've previously used hosted Postgres databases at Heroku. I'm starting with the hosted version and experimenting with the self hosted version to see how well I can maintain it.

I started with an [AI project](/ai) to import all of the markdown files from this documentation but I'm starting another test project so that I can learn how to more accurately control the vector embeddings.
