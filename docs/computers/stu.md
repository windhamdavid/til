# Stu ðŸª©

**25/04/07** - my new Mac Studio came in over the weekend. Right now I'm calling it Stu and it seems like it's going to stick. It's an upgrade I promised myself to go along with the new [ Studio](/notes/house/studio). It's a replacement for my old Mac Mini ( [Magic](/docs/computers/magic.md) ) which was the last of my local machines not on an ARM architecture. It's a hoss and will serve as my primary desktop. I remember when 1GB of memory was considered outrageous. I don't have the time to dig into the setup at the moment but I'm starting this page to document as I go. Every time I spin up a new machine ( local or server ) I like to take the time to make some considerations on possible changes.
