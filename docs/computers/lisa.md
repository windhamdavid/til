# Lisa ðŸ“±

M1 iPad Pro - on the road or couch. The name is a reference to the [1983 Apple model and Lisa Simpson](https://davidawindham.com/lisa/) which is appropriate given the amount of time spent on [_The Simpsons - Tapped Out_](https://davidawindham.com/the-simpsons/). Although it's mostly remote configuration and third party apps here, I need a place to keep some references.
