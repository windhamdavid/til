# Shaarli

[davidawindham.com/bookmarks](https://davidawindham.com/bookmarks/)

I use Shaarli as a bookmarking service that syncs with my [Feed Reader](Miniflux) and feeds the bookmarks on my [archive page](https://davidawindham.com/archive). I've used it for about ten years now and the database stays really small.
