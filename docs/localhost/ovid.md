# Ovid ðŸ’»

11/23/21 - Apple Store pickup
Moved my desk around, did some cable management, moved my old MacBook Pro so that I could share the screen for referencing configuration.
Booted her up and loaded up activity monitor and command line top to watch the processes closely to see what's running. I always avoid using the migration assistant so that I can start clean. My main goal is to keep the machine as minimal and simple as possible. I am going to try and avoid running any x86 processes under Rosetta in my attempt to go fully ARM. I wrote a quick post about why I purchased it and why I named it Ovid @ [https://davidawindham.com/ovid](https://davidawindham.com/ovid) and I'll document the rest of the it here.
